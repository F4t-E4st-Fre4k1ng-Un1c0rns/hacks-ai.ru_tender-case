| SSTS lacks mention of the system's ability to adapt to multiple user preferences over time, while UC requires this personalization feature. | "The system will log each user interaction and preference to enhance future voice control responses, ensuring the vehicle’s settings align with the user's habitual preferences." |
| UC specifies integration with cloud-based features to enhance voice control personalization, but SSTS only mentions "stable connectivity" without detailing cloud integration. | "The vehicle has stable connectivity, whether local or cloud-based, to support voice control features that may require real-time data processing or updates." |
| SSTS does not fully address background noise handling or its impact on the system’s functionality, whereas UC specifies minimal noise for optimal voice control. | "The microphone array inside the vehicle is unblocked, calibrated, and in proper working condition to accurately capture voice commands." |
| SSTS does not provide specific details about handling multi-step commands or providing individualized feedback for each adjustment, as required by UC. | "For multi-step commands (e.g., seat position followed by climate settings), the system will adjust settings in sequence and provide confirmation after each adjustment." |
| SSTS mentions general user prompts for unclear commands but lacks explicit clarity on the system's fallback mechanisms when voice control is unavailable, which is detailed in UC. | "If the system encounters difficulty in processing the command (e.g., due to background noise or unclear speech), it will prompt the user to repeat or clarify the command." |
| SSTS does not specify handling cases where the voice control system cannot access certain vehicle settings or data, which UC expects for error management. | "The system will exit if it detects an error in system functionality (e.g., microphone or software failure)." |
| UC requires that the system be fully adaptable to multiple languages, but SSTS only mentions multi-language support without further explanation on its dynamic adaptability. | "The system supports multiple languages, and the user has selected the desired language through initial configuration." |
| SSTS does not provide specific mechanisms for exiting the voice control system when user preferences change or after a set period of inactivity, as required by UC. | "The system will exit automatically after successfully processing the voice command and adjusting the vehicle settings. A confirmation response will be provided before exit." |
