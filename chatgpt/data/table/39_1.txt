| The UC specifies automatic activation of the system when the vehicle is in motion, but the SSTS does not clarify the specific activation process based on vehicle movement. | "The system automatically activates when the vehicle begins to move and the sensors are ready." |
| The UC mentions visual and audible warnings, but does not specify the system’s logging of interventions, which is outlined in the SSTS. | "The system logs each intervention, including the detected threat, the system's response, and whether a collision was avoided, for diagnostic and improvement purposes." |
| The UC describes automatic steering adjustments as part of the collision avoidance, while the SSTS does not clearly define the range of automatic steering capabilities, especially at higher speeds. | "The system may also automatically adjust the steering to avoid a collision, particularly at lower speeds or in tight spaces." |
| The UC specifies the system will return to its monitoring state after successfully avoiding a collision, but the SSTS includes conditions for disabling the system in case of failure, which is not mentioned in the UC. | "If a system malfunction is detected (e.g., sensor failure or loss of signal), the system will disable itself, and a warning will be displayed on the dashboard, prompting the driver to seek assistance." |
| The UC requires the system to be engaged in collision avoidance actions at any threat, but the SSTS provides more specific criteria regarding the proximity of threats to trigger action, which is not clearly mentioned in the UC. | "If an object enters a predefined proximity range (e.g., 2 meters for pedestrians, 5 meters for other vehicles), the system begins assessing collision risk." |
