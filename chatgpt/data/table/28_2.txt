| SSTS does not fully automate driving maneuvers such as lane changes or steering adjustments, whereas UC implies automation for these maneuvers. | "The system primarily focuses on speed adjustments, weather conditions, and hazard warnings without a clear indication that the system will trigger more complex maneuvers such as steering adjustments or lane changes." |
| SSTS lacks specific calibration for adaptive driving modes (e.g., Eco, Sport) as required in the UC. | "The vehicle is calibrated for its specific parameters, including speed capabilities, handling characteristics, and preferred driving modes (e.g., Eco, Comfort, Sport)." |
| SSTS does not clearly define a fallback mechanism or protocol for extended data loss, which is a requirement in the UC. | "If external data becomes unavailable, the system will alert the driver and suggest switching to a default safety mode, such as reduced speed or cautious driving, until the connection is restored." |
| SSTS does not provide an automatic system recovery or clear exit protocol in cases of prolonged system malfunction, unlike UC which expects a safety protocol. | "The system will notify the driver and recommend manual driving adjustments." |
| SSTS does not specify full automation for adaptive speed changes based on external conditions, leaving some actions to the driver, unlike the UC's requirement for fully automated recommendations. | "The system automatically adjusts its speed in response to the recommendation if the driver does not manually override the suggestion." |
