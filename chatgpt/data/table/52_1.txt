| UC requires consistent real-time connectivity between the app and the vehicle, but SSTS mentions potential disconnections. | "The system might face temporary disconnections due to weak signals or hardware incompatibility. In such cases, the app might fail to deliver real-time data or update usage information." |
| UC specifies push notifications must be delivered in a timely manner, but SSTS acknowledges possible delays in notification delivery. | "Occasionally, push notifications may not be delivered on time due to server issues or mobile network problems." |
| UC demands fully accurate and real-time diagnostics, but SSTS allows for inaccuracies in diagnostic data. | "In certain scenarios, the diagnostic data might not be 100% accurate or real-time, particularly if there are issues with the vehicle’s sensor data transmission or if the vehicle is not properly connected to the system." |
| UC requires complete compliance with data privacy laws, while SSTS notes potential gaps in regional compliance. | "While the system follows industry-standard encryption protocols, some areas of the vehicle data management may need further refinement to ensure complete compliance with regional data privacy laws." |
| UC requires clear, actionable error messages, but SSTS mentions generic error messages without resolution guidance. | "In cases of minor system errors or malfunctions, the user may only receive generic error messages without detailed instructions on how to resolve the issue." |
