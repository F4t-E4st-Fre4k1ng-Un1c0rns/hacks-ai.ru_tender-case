|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS lacks explicit mention of manual user-triggered actions for data analysis, as outlined in the UC. | "The fleet manager can manually trigger a data refresh or request a detailed analysis for specific vehicles or fleet-wide performance metrics." |
| SSTS does not specify the ability to export customizable or flexible data reports, as expected in the UC. | "Detailed reports can be exported in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF) for record-keeping, further analysis, or sharing with other team members." |
| The UC assumes that a variety of devices can be used by the fleet manager, but SSTS only mentions desktop and mobile devices without detailing the range of device compatibility. | "Fleet managers must have authorized user credentials and access to the system’s dashboard interface, which may be accessed via desktop or mobile devices." |
| The SSTS exit conditions do not fully address the scenario of incomplete data collection due to connectivity issues, as described in the UC. | "If the data collection process is interrupted due to loss of connectivity or sensor failure, the system exits with an error notification and prompts the user to take corrective action." |
| SSTS does not provide sufficient detail on automated fleet-wide optimization suggestions based on analytics, which is mentioned in the UC. | "Actionable insights, including recommendations for optimizing fleet performance or reducing maintenance costs, are displayed in the dashboard and available for review." |
| The SSTS does not specifically mention handling non-urgent vehicle alerts, as the UC implied could be part of the operational flow. | "The system triggers maintenance alerts when predefined thresholds (e.g., battery below a certain level, scheduled maintenance due) are reached." |
