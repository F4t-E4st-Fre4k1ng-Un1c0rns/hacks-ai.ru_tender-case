| The UC requires full integration of vehicle alerts with home automation (e.g., lights, alarms, cameras), while the SSTS only partially supports it, with limitations in full feature synchronization. | "The system provides notifications for security alerts (e.g., unauthorized access attempts), but the integration with home automation functions such as lighting or alarm triggers is limited." |
| The UC specifies real-time synchronization and immediate response to user commands, while the SSTS mentions potential delays in the system's responsiveness. | "Confirmation of actions (e.g., vehicle lock/unlock) is provided, though with potential delays in response time depending on system performance." |
| UC requires seamless and fully functional home automation feature synchronization, including advanced features like camera sync, while the SSTS only supports basic vehicle security updates and status monitoring. | "The home automation system must support basic security integration (e.g., vehicle status updates), but advanced automation features may not be fully supported." |
| The UC specifies that the vehicle's status should be immediately updated and shown, whereas the SSTS allows for potential delays in status updates and notifications. | "The mobile app or home automation hub displays the current security status of the vehicle (locked/unlocked), but with potential delays in response time depending on system performance." |
| The UC requires automatic failure handling and quick recovery from connectivity issues, while the SSTS only mentions error messages and troubleshooting steps without ensuring seamless recovery. | "In the event of connectivity issues, an error message is displayed, instructing the user to check network connectivity or follow troubleshooting steps." |
