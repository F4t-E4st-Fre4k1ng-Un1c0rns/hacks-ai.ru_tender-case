| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not explicitly mention the need for continuous GPS and network connectivity to ensure the system functions reliably in all scenarios. UC specifies this requirement for smooth operation. | *"The system is configured to communicate with toll operators, parking facilities, and external payment service providers through an internet connection."* |
| UC includes a detailed fallback scenario for manual payment methods if the automated payment system fails, whereas SSTS only briefly mentions error handling without clear user instructions for manual payment. | *"If a payment fails due to technical issues (e.g., connectivity failure), the system exits the transaction process, logs the error, and notifies the driver of the issue."* |
| UC expects that users will be given the option to manually override payment failure in any situation, but SSTS does not mention this capability explicitly. | *"In the event of an unresolved failure (e.g., network downtime or incompatible toll system), the driver is prompted to use an alternative payment method, such as manual payment or a mobile app."* |
| SSTS does not specify how the system should handle regional compatibility for toll/parking systems, a requirement noted in the UC for full functionality across different regions. | *"The system is configured to communicate with toll operators, parking facilities, and external payment service providers..."* (No further specification on regional compatibility) |
| UC requires the system to continue attempting payment or provide an alternative method if communication with toll or parking systems fails. SSTS does not fully detail this retry or alternative method handling. | *"The system logs the error and exits the process without completing the transaction."* |
