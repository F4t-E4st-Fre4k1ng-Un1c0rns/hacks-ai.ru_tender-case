| The UC requires the system to automatically adjust the seat to a saved profile instantly, while the SSTS mentions a possible delay in profile retrieval. | "The seat adjusts automatically to the stored position. A confirmation message is displayed on the vehicle's screen (e.g., 'Profile 1 retrieved')." |
| The UC requires the system to always provide clear confirmation when saving or retrieving a profile, but the SSTS mentions potential inconsistency in feedback. | "In rare cases, users may not receive an immediate confirmation of the action, leading to confusion or uncertainty about whether the adjustment was successful." |
| The UC states that the system should notify users with a user-friendly error message if the memory is full, but the SSTS does not guarantee clarity in error messages. | "The system will display an error message (e.g., 'Memory Full: Overwrite required') and prevent further profiles from being saved unless a profile is deleted or overwritten." |
| The UC requires the ability to overwrite profiles when the memory is full, but the SSTS does not clearly indicate that users can delete profiles to free memory. | "The system displays an error message (e.g., 'Memory Full: Overwrite required') and prevents further profiles from being saved unless a profile is deleted or overwritten." |
| The UC specifies that the system must support up to three user profiles, but the SSTS mentions potential issues with memory slot management. | "Users have reported that memory slots may not always free up properly when overwriting old profiles, leading to occasional memory full errors." |
