| SSTS does not explicitly mention automatic synchronization of all user preferences across devices, such as volume levels or preferred routes. | "The system confirms that data (e.g., navigation routes, media playback status, user preferences) is successfully synchronized between the in-car system and smartphone app." |
| SSTS does not clarify the requirement for both devices to be on the latest software versions, which is specified in the UC. | "Both the in-car system and smartphone app must be running compatible software versions, with the latest updates installed to ensure proper operation and seamless data transfer." |
| The UC specifies that the system should trigger based on the user's physical movement (e.g., entering or exiting the car), while SSTS only mentions user interaction and device connection. | "A transition is triggered when the user physically moves between the vehicle and the smartphone, such as exiting or entering the vehicle, or when the user switches between devices." |
| SSTS mentions that user notifications will occur but does not specify the continuation of settings such as volume or preferences, which is outlined in the UC. | "The user is notified upon successful transition, either through the in-car display or smartphone notification, confirming the continuation of the activity." |
| SSTS does not mention a recovery process for the user in the event of an error, while UC specifies that users should be able to continue their activity post-error. | "In the event of a software incompatibility or other system error, the user will receive a notification, and the system will provide instructions to resolve the issue (e.g., update software, reconnect devices)." |
