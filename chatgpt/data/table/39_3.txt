| The UC specifies that the system must provide continuous updates to the driver during monitoring, but the SSTS only mentions alerts and interventions without continuous feedback. | "The system continuously monitors and updates the status of detected objects and recalculates the risk to provide real-time feedback to the driver." |
| The UC requires that the system operate only when the vehicle is in motion, but the SSTS does not mention this condition explicitly. | "The vehicle’s engine and control systems must be fully operational, with the vehicle in motion for collision detection and intervention capabilities to be fully active." |
| The UC specifies that the system provides real-time updates during warnings, but the SSTS only specifies alerts and intervention actions without emphasizing real-time data feedback. | "When a potential collision is detected, the system will generate an immediate visual (dashboard light) and audible (sound alert) warning to the driver." |
| The UC emphasizes the logging of all relevant data after system interaction, but the SSTS only mentions event logging without detailed specification of what data should be logged. | "After each intervention or warning, the system logs the event for future analysis and review." |
| The UC mentions that the system will deactivate after the risk has been mitigated, but the SSTS does not mention the requirement for system reset after intervention. | "The system resets to a normal monitoring state once the danger has passed and no further threats are detected." |
