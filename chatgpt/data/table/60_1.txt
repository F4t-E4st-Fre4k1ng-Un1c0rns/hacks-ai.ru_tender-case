|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not explicitly mention voice control as an enabling condition, which is required by the UC. | "The system requires an active internet connection for cloud-based storage of user preferences and settings, if applicable." |
| UC specifies more detailed environmental triggers like automatic adjustments for time of day and weather, but SSTS does not fully address these automatic triggers. | "The system may also trigger automatically based on environmental inputs, such as adjusting the lighting based on the time of day (e.g., activating a 'night mode' preset), weather conditions, or driving mode (e.g., sport mode triggering high-intensity lighting)." |
| SSTS does not clarify how user settings are managed across sessions and may imply settings are not fully retained in all cases, while UC expects persistence of settings across multiple vehicle sessions. | "Upon system shutdown, any unsaved settings or adjustments will be discarded unless manually saved to the user’s profile." |
| SSTS does not clearly state that custom user profiles are automatically applied each time the car is started, whereas UC specifies automatic retrieval of user settings. | "User-defined settings, including custom color combinations and lighting modes, are saved under the user’s profile for future use. These settings will automatically apply upon the next vehicle startup, ensuring the lighting environment is tailored to the user’s preferences." |
| SSTS lacks emphasis on the saving and retrieval of custom settings in a more specific and proactive manner, as required by UC. | "User-defined settings, including custom lighting configurations, are saved under the user’s profile for future use." |
