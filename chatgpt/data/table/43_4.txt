| SSTS does not specify the need for integration with a car’s digital ecosystem or user profile, which is required for personalized recommendations in the UC. | "The system must support an onboard digital system that integrates with the Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations sub-system." |
| SSTS lacks clear mention of user-initiated activation for the fuel efficiency tracking feature, which is a requirement in the UC. | "The system can also be manually triggered by the user through the vehicle's interface or connected app (e.g., by selecting a 'Fuel Efficiency' mode)." |
| SSTS only provides general recommendations without a specific emphasis on personalized, real-time, actionable feedback based on individual driving patterns, as required by the UC. | "The system will provide tailored recommendations for improving driving habits, such as reducing aggressive acceleration or maintaining a steady speed." |
| SSTS mentions "summary reports" but does not highlight that these reports should be generated **at the end of each trip**, a requirement of the UC. | "After a trip, the system generates a summary report, offering insights on the overall fuel efficiency of the trip, efficiency score, and personalized recommendations for the next trip." |
| SSTS lacks detailed post-trip efficiency summary specifications, which the UC explicitly requires. | "The system will also exit when the user manually deactivates the feature via the app or vehicle interface, or when the system detects an inactive session (e.g., prolonged engine idle without movement)." |
