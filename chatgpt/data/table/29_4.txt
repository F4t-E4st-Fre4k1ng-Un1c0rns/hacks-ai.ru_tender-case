| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not mention the need for compatibility checks between smartphone OS and the car’s infotainment system, which is required in the UC. | *"The system assumes that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are the only viable connectivity options, excluding other potential connectivity methods such as NFC, USB, or direct hotspot connections."* |
| SSTS lacks explicit user-configurable settings for manual transition, as required in the UC for flexibility in user interaction. | *"The transition only occurs when the system detects the user leaving or entering the car. There is no user-configurable setting that allows the user to manually trigger or pause the transition."* |
| SSTS does not address the issue of maintaining real-time data (e.g., ongoing route changes or traffic alerts) between the in-car system and the smartphone, a key requirement in the UC. | *"The system does not retain certain contextual data, such as ongoing route changes or traffic alerts, between the two devices, leading to disruptions in navigation flow."* |
| SSTS fails to provide clear feedback or troubleshooting steps when a transition attempt fails, contrary to the UC’s requirement for error messaging. | *"Currently, users experience a silent failure with no feedback."* |
| SSTS does not explicitly manage multiple app transitions (e.g., from navigation to media and climate control), which is specified in the UC. | *"The system does not manage state synchronization, leading to a degraded experience."* |
| SSTS does not describe a clear, consistent method for exiting a session or gracefully ending the task, which is required in the UC for proper session management. | *"The system fails to provide clear exit conditions upon the user leaving the car or exiting the app."* |
| SSTS does not support automatic app updates, which would be essential for maintaining seamless transitions, as required in the UC. | *"There is no provision for automatic app updates on either platform to ensure seamless transitions when updates are released."* |
