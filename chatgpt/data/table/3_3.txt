| UC assumes full functionality of the Adaptive Cruise Control system, while the SSTS indicates "Partially Compliant," suggesting that the system may not always operate as expected. | "The system must be in a functional state, with no ongoing errors in its sensors or software." |
| UC focuses on a seamless user experience, but the SSTS includes conditions where the system might fail or not engage properly, such as sensor malfunctions or environmental issues. | "A sensor or system malfunction is detected, causing the system to automatically disengage." |
| UC does not mention specific conditions under which the system may fail to activate, while the SSTS outlines conditions like insufficient speed or sensor failure that could prevent activation. | "The vehicle must be moving at or above the minimum speed required for the ACC system to engage (typically 30 km/h or 18 mph)." |
| The UC does not explicitly describe the possibility of system failure due to road obstructions or environmental conditions, but the SSTS does. | "If external conditions (e.g., road obstructions, extreme weather) affect the system’s functionality, the system may deactivate automatically." |
| UC describes the user interface and settings adjustments without limitations, whereas the SSTS includes technical restrictions, such as needing a functioning system for customization. | "The system must be in a functional state, with no ongoing errors in its sensors or software." |
| UC describes a smooth interaction with ACC settings, but the SSTS acknowledges that the system could disengage due to specific failures or errors. | "The system disengages automatically if the vehicle’s speed drops below the minimum threshold for ACC activation." |
| UC expects the system to always confirm and display the user’s customized settings, whereas the SSTS only mentions the display when the system is operating normally and doesn't clarify if settings can be saved or recalled. | "The system provides feedback to the driver through visual indicators on the dashboard or a display (e.g., the selected speed and following distance)." |
