| Voice command recognition is not fully reliable in real-world conditions, as indicated by occasional misinterpretations. | "The system currently experiences occasional misinterpretations of voice commands in noisy environments, requiring a manual override or repetition of commands." |
| Real-time traffic data is unavailable in some areas with poor internet connectivity, which the UC expects to be consistent. | "The system does not always handle intermittent connectivity well. In areas with unstable internet, navigation may experience delays or fail to display accurate information about routes or traffic." |
| The transition from voice commands to manual input is not always smooth, which contradicts the UC’s requirement for seamless interaction. | "While the system does allow manual input, the transition is not always smooth. Occasionally, it causes the user interface to freeze momentarily or creates delays in rerouting." |
| The system occasionally fails to recognize user-specific voice profiles in cases of accents or speech variations. | "The system’s voice profile setup is functional but not fully optimized. Users may experience delays in profile creation, and in some cases, the system fails to recognize the voice profiles of users with accents or speech variations." |
| The confirmation feedback from the system is inconsistent and may not always verbalize the status of the user’s route or destination. | "The confirmation feedback is inconsistent. While it functions correctly in most cases, there are instances when the system fails to verbally confirm route changes or destination arrivals." |
| Internet connectivity issues lead to degraded system performance, which is not sufficiently addressed in the UC. | "In areas with unstable internet, navigation may experience delays or fail to display accurate information about routes or traffic, deviating from the expected behavior in the underpinning contract." |
| Hands-free control is limited, with certain functions requiring manual interaction. | "While hands-free control works for basic commands, more complex functions such as adjusting route preferences or changing destination require manual input or additional voice commands, which affects the user’s ability to interact with the system without distractions." |
