|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The UC requires **real-time updates** for vehicle health data, whereas the SSTS only provides **intermittent updates** due to potential connectivity issues. | "The battery health information is updated intermittently and may not always reflect real-time conditions due to connectivity or sensor issues." |
| The UC specifies that **vehicle diagnostics** should include comprehensive metrics (e.g., tire pressure, brake wear, fluid levels), but the SSTS mentions that some diagnostics may not be available for all vehicles. | "Not all health parameters are consistently reported, and certain diagnostic readings (e.g., coolant levels) may be omitted due to sensor limitations." |
| The UC requires **accurate real-time location tracking**, while the SSTS notes that location data may be **inaccurate or delayed** in certain conditions. | "Geolocation tracking is only functional when the vehicle is within close proximity and the connection is stable. Additionally, location data may be inaccurate or delayed in areas with poor GPS signal or weak connectivity." |
| The UC states that the app should provide **actionable maintenance notifications**; the SSTS mentions that the alerts may be **generic** and not always actionable. | "The notifications may also be generic, lacking detailed actionable instructions for service or repairs, particularly for complex issues requiring manual inspection." |
| The UC specifies that error handling should provide **clear and actionable** steps, while the SSTS states that error messages may be **vague** and less user-friendly. | "The system's error messages can be vague, providing limited troubleshooting advice." |
| The UC emphasizes **continuous data availability** with minimal interruptions, whereas the SSTS states that the system may experience **interruptions** in data retrieval due to connectivity issues. | "The app is sometimes unable to retrieve live data from the vehicle, and users may experience interruptions in data reporting." |
