| The UC expects continuous detection of traffic signs from all angles, while the SSTS limits the detection range to the cameras' field of view. | "The system is optimized for detecting signs within the field of view of two cameras, which may not always cover all environmental angles." |
| UC specifies that auditory alerts should be provided for all detected traffic signs, but SSTS only triggers audio alerts for certain signs that require immediate action. | "The system’s auditory alerts are only triggered for signs that require immediate driver action, such as speed limits that differ significantly from the current speed or stop signs." |
| UC requires continuous restoration attempts in case of failure, while SSTS only provides error notification and requires manual intervention to restore functionality. | "The system does not continuously attempt to restore functionality in real-time. Instead, the system requires manual intervention (e.g., sensor recalibration or system reset) to restore the feature." |
| UC assumes the system operates independently of external factors, while SSTS requires GPS data for accurate sign detection and performance can degrade in low-signal areas. | "The system requires GPS data for accurate sign detection and interpretation, which may not always be available in low-signal areas (e.g., tunnels or remote locations)." |
| UC outlines seamless user interaction without interruptions, while SSTS allows manual deactivation of the feature by the driver. | "The system will deactivate if the driver manually disables the feature via the settings menu." |
