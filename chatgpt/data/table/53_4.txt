| SSTS does not mention explicit secure authentication methods before granting vehicle access, while UC requires authentication (e.g., biometric or app-based verification). | "The system detects and authenticates a paired Bluetooth device (such as a smartphone) within proximity to the vehicle." |
| UC specifies that the vehicle should be started via Bluetooth after unlocking, while SSTS only mentions powering on the vehicle without detailing the start process. | "The vehicle’s ignition is enabled, and the system continuously maintains Bluetooth connection while the vehicle is in operation." |
| SSTS does not clearly define the requirement to maintain Bluetooth connectivity throughout the vehicle session as stated in the UC. | "The system logs the successful access event for security auditing purposes." |
| UC specifies that Bluetooth access should be disabled when the user exits the vehicle, but SSTS does not explicitly mention this in the exit conditions. | "The system disables Bluetooth access when the user exits the vehicle, ensuring no further unauthorized access can occur." |
| SSTS lacks a detailed specification for handling access control during an unsuccessful Bluetooth connection, which is covered in the UC. | "Upon successful authentication, the vehicle automatically unlocks, and the vehicle’s interior lights activate, signaling access approval." |
| UC requires the vehicle to lock automatically after the user exits the vehicle, but SSTS only mentions locking the doors after the Bluetooth connection is lost. | "The system locks the doors and disables Bluetooth access after a predefined timeout (e.g., 2 minutes)." |
