|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC requires fully seamless integration for automatic traffic light adjustments and route optimization in all cases. The SSTS mentions partial adjustments based on proximity, not guaranteeing seamless integration in all scenarios. | "The vehicle adjusts its speed in real-time to optimize for green lights or to minimize stop-and-go traffic, ensuring smooth transitions at intersections." |
| UC requires comprehensive hazard notifications in all cases. The SSTS only provides hazard alerts when infrastructure data is available, which may not be consistent in all locations. | "Real-time hazard alerts, such as road construction or accidents, are displayed to the driver, along with potential rerouting suggestions when necessary." |
| UC specifies that charging station notifications should be available in all circumstances, while SSTS limits charging station availability notifications to certain conditions or locations. | "The vehicle notifies the driver of nearby available charging stations and their status (e.g., occupied or available), helping to plan charging stops." |
| UC requires alternative solutions for communication failure scenarios, but the SSTS does not fully detail alternative methods or guarantees in case of failure. | "If a communication failure occurs, the system attempts to reconnect, but the feature may be temporarily disabled until the connection is reestablished or the system is manually restarted." |
| UC requires full data integrity and privacy protection, including end-to-end encryption, which is not clearly specified in the SSTS. | *No relevant quotation found in SSTS regarding data encryption or end-to-end security measures.* |
