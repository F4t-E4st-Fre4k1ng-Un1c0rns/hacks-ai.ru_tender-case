| The SSTS lacks detailed mention of automatic switching between devices based on usage behavior, as required by the UC. | "The system will automatically switch between connected devices based on usage context, such as switching from media streaming to incoming calls, without requiring user input." |
| The UC specifies automatic reconnection of devices when entering the vehicle, while the SSTS only mentions the attempt to pair devices within range, not reconnection. | "Upon entering the vehicle in future, the system will automatically attempt to reconnect to previously paired devices, providing a seamless transition from disconnection to active use." |
| The UC requires clear and timely notifications for successful device pairing, but the SSTS only provides vague confirmation without specifics on timing or clarity. | "The system will provide a visual or auditory confirmation on the infotainment screen once devices are paired, indicating which device is connected for which functionality." |
| The UC describes handling alternative scenarios if pairing fails, whereas the SSTS does not specify error handling or prompts when pairing is unsuccessful. | "The system will scan for available Bluetooth devices within range and initiate the pairing process when Bluetooth is enabled on the devices." |
| The UC implies that device prioritization should consider both types of devices and their functionalities, but the SSTS does not explicitly define how devices are prioritized. | "In cases where multiple devices are detected, the system will attempt to pair them sequentially, prioritizing the device for calls, followed by devices for media streaming or navigation." |
| The UC states that Bluetooth profiles must be compatible, but the SSTS does not specify the required profiles or compatibility checks. | "The devices must be compatible with the vehicle’s Bluetooth profiles, supporting necessary functions such as calls, media streaming, and navigation." |
