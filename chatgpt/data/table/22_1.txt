| UC specifies that the system should provide specific recommendations for alternative parking locations in real-time if the selected spot is unavailable, but the SSTS only mentions notifying the user of the lack of availability. | "The system may not always provide 'specific recommendations' for alternative locations in real time due to limitations in external parking data integration." |
| UC requires parking details such as pricing and restrictions to be included in real-time notifications, while the SSTS may fail to provide this information due to gaps in the data provider's database. | "The system may fail to offer complete parking details such as pricing or time limits due to gaps in the parking data provider's database or limitations in real-time integration." |
| UC requires the system to exit and provide data updates when no parking is available, whereas the SSTS does not handle the scenario where no parking options are available effectively. | "If the user does not select a parking spot (e.g., if the notification is ignored or the parking spot is missed), the system may exit without recording relevant data, potentially leading to incomplete or inaccurate system logs." |
| UC specifies the system should handle poor connectivity, but SSTS may allow limited functionality under such conditions. | "The system may still function with partial GPS accuracy or limited connectivity, but it could degrade the performance (e.g., less frequent updates, limited parking information)." |
| UC requires the system to guide the user continuously toward available parking, but the SSTS only mentions starting parking data gathering after destination selection. | "The system starts tracking the user’s location using GPS and starts gathering parking availability data based on the chosen destination and preferences." |
