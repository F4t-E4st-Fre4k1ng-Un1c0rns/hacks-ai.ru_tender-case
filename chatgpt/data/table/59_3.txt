| The UC specifies real-time updates for all battery parameters, but SSTS only provides an overview of data transmission with potential delays in certain conditions. | "The system updates all battery-related information and delivers notifications about charging progress and critical issues." |
| The UC requires the ability to view detailed battery metrics such as charge cycles, but SSTS does not explicitly guarantee this level of detail. | "The system provides a real-time display of the EV battery’s charge percentage, health status, voltage, temperature, and charge cycles." |
| The UC states that alerts should trigger for a broader range of battery health issues, while SSTS only mentions triggers for charge percentage and communication failures. | "The system generates alerts for abnormal conditions such as low charge, overheating, or significant degradation of the battery’s health." |
| The UC requires historical data to be stored and accessed after each session, but SSTS does not explicitly ensure that data is saved for future reference after every interaction. | "Session data will be saved after the user exits, allowing users to review past battery data and charging history for future reference." |
| The UC specifies that alerts should be triggered by battery temperature issues, but the SSTS only mentions a general "abnormal condition" without specifying this parameter clearly. | "The system generates alerts for abnormal conditions such as low charge, overheating, or significant degradation of the battery’s health." |
| The UC mentions that the system should ensure ongoing battery health monitoring in the background, but SSTS does not clearly describe background monitoring after session exit. | "The system will stop transmitting real-time data unless the user re-engages with the application." |
