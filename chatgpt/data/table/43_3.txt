| The UC requires real-time, seamless recommendations and updates, but the SSTS mentions intermittent delays and partial data synchronization. | "The system provides fuel efficiency data, but updates and recommendations may be delayed or only partially accurate due to occasional lapses in data synchronization between the vehicle's sensors and the cloud service." |
| UC mandates full functionality in both online and offline modes, while the SSTS limits offline functionality to basic data display and lacks full recommendation access. | "Basic functionality is available even in offline mode, though recommendations may not be fully personalized." |
| UC expects deep, personalized recommendations based on specific road conditions or traffic, but the SSTS offers generic advice without such specific data integration. | "The system provides basic recommendations (e.g., adjust speed, improve driving habits), but the suggestions lack depth and are not sufficiently personalized in all cases." |
| UC requires long-term performance reports that account for all driving conditions, but the SSTS notes missing data for some conditions, such as city vs. highway driving. | "The system offers long-term tracking, but the reports are incomplete and sometimes do not reflect all of the user’s driving behavior. For example, data from certain driving conditions (e.g., city vs. highway driving) may not be included in the long-term reports." |
| UC expects complete, accurate error handling during failures, but the SSTS allows the system to exit without clear offline functionality or recommendations when errors occur. | "If connectivity is lost for extended periods, the system provides a summary of data collected before the loss of connection and offers offline recommendations based on the last available data." |
| UC expects uninterrupted real-time data transmission, but the SSTS allows for errors in data collection and synchronization during connectivity issues. | "While the system relies on cloud-based recommendations, it experiences intermittent connectivity issues, particularly in areas with weak mobile or internet signals." |
