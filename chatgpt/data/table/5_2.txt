| UC requires full automation of vehicle alignment and charging initiation, whereas SSTS allows manual user interaction to start the process. | "The technical specifications mention that the user may manually engage the charging process, either through a button press or app command, to begin charging." |
| UC specifies the system should automatically monitor charging progress, while SSTS allows for potential delays or user-initiated progress updates. | "The system will provide updates on charging status, including any errors or interruptions that may occur during the charging process, potentially initiated by the user’s request." |
| UC indicates that charging should automatically stop when the battery is full, but SSTS suggests manual intervention may be needed. | "Charging may be manually stopped by the user, either through the app or vehicle controls, if desired." |
| UC requires automatic charging session termination after full charge, while SSTS leaves room for manual user control to end the session. | "Charging may be manually stopped by the user, either through the app or vehicle controls, if desired." |
| UC describes that the vehicle should automatically align and detect the charging pad, but SSTS suggests user input could be involved in alignment or positioning. | "The system detects and aligns the vehicle automatically, but if the user fails to align the vehicle, they may need to adjust it based on system guidance." |
| UC specifies charging should commence immediately upon detection, whereas SSTS mentions a potential need for manual initiation. | "Charging will automatically begin once the vehicle is properly aligned, with no further manual interaction required, but can also be initiated via the user app or onboard controls." |
