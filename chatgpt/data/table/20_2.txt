|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The UC specifies that the system should guide the driver through action steps (e.g., pull over, call for help), but the SSTS does not fully elaborate on these action prompts. | "The system will display an emergency alert on the vehicle’s dashboard, with a corresponding visual message..." |
| The UC includes a manual interaction step for the driver to press a "Call Emergency Services" button, but the SSTS only mentions automatic system actions. | "The system will attempt to contact emergency services, sending data including the vehicle’s GPS location..." |
| UC expects the system to be more flexible in enabling/disabling alerts dynamically during operation, but SSTS mentions only the initial setup or system menu activation. | "The emergency alert system must be activated during the vehicle’s initial setup or via the system settings menu." |
| The UC specifies fallback procedures when the system fails (manual intervention and contacting emergency services), but SSTS does not provide a detailed fallback manual response. | "In the event of a system failure, the system will provide a fallback prompt: 'Please manually call emergency services.'" |
| UC states that the system must provide a confirmation message after successful emergency response, whereas SSTS lacks an explicit confirmation message in the output section. | "The driver will be presented with a confirmation message: 'Emergency services have been contacted. Stay calm. Help is on the way.'" |
