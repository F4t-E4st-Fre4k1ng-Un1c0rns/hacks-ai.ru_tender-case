|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC specifies real-time parking notifications based on the availability of spots near the user's location without requiring a destination, whereas SSTS requires a destination to trigger parking updates. | "The user selects a parking area or a destination where they wish to park." |
| UC emphasizes immediate, up-to-the-minute parking updates, while SSTS mentions relying on third-party data sources that could introduce delays or inaccuracies in real-time updates. | "The system relies on third-party data sources (e.g., sensor data, parking service APIs) for parking availability information." |
| UC states that the system must automatically update parking status in real time after a parking transaction is completed, but SSTS does not detail such automatic updates post-parking. | "The system records the user’s parking transaction upon successful parking, and updates the availability status of the spot in real-time." (Does not explicitly mention automatic updates after parking event) |
| UC requires seamless integration of the system with the vehicle’s navigation system, while SSTS only mentions integration with navigation but without specific functionality details or clarity on seamless operation. | "The vehicle should be compatible with the integrated navigation system if in-vehicle navigation is used." |
| UC requires notifications based on real-time proximity and availability, but SSTS focuses only on notifications triggered by user input (destination setting). | "The user sets a desired parking area or destination." |
| UC defines a more proactive notification system, but SSTS only describes notifications triggered after the user selects a destination or parking area. | "The user selects a parking area or a destination where they wish to park." |
| UC specifies that parking status should be continuously updated in real time as the user approaches the parking location, while SSTS does not elaborate on continuous updates during navigation. | "The system continuously monitors and updates parking spot availability as the user approaches the selected location." (Not clearly tied to real-time updates as the user approaches) |
