|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **SSTS includes technical conditions for system activation** (e.g., system must be in a non-error state), while the UC only describes basic user-facing conditions. | "The system must be in a non-error state with no malfunction notifications (e.g., sensor failure, software error)." |
| **SSTS details specific sensor and vehicle condition prerequisites** (e.g., road conditions and sensor data must allow customization), while the UC is more general about enabling conditions. | "The vehicle should be on a road where adaptive cruise control can operate effectively (e.g., clear lane, minimal obstruction, and safe road conditions)." |
| **SSTS focuses on system response to inputs and operational state after customization**, while the UC focuses on the user's interaction and outcomes. | "The system adjusts its driving strategies, such as maintaining the set following distance or adjusting speed based on traffic conditions and road scenarios, according to the user’s preferences." |
| **SSTS includes more specific failure handling and fallback procedures** for when customization is unavailable, which is not explicitly described in the UC. | "If any error or malfunction occurs, the system enters a fallback mode, where customization options may be temporarily unavailable, and standard settings are applied automatically." |
| **SSTS does not explicitly mention user confirmation for customization, unlike UC** which outlines user feedback after settings are adjusted. | "Feedback is provided to the user via the system interface, confirming that the settings have been applied successfully (e.g., 'Settings updated' notification)." |
| **SSTS discusses saving settings persistently, whereas UC implies that the settings may reset or need to be manually reapplied.** | "User-selected settings are saved and persist across subsequent trips, ensuring that the system continues to operate with the customized parameters unless manually adjusted again." |
