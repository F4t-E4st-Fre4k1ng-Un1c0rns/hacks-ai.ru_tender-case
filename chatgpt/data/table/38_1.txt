| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS lacks explicit mention of actionable feedback for driving behavior improvement, unlike the UC. | "The system generates performance reports after each trip and periodic summaries on a weekly basis, offering actionable suggestions for improvement." (SSTS does not clarify actionable suggestions) |
| SSTS does not explicitly include "unsafe driving behavior" as a trigger condition, as mentioned in UC. | "Real-time monitoring is triggered when driving behavior exceeds predefined thresholds, such as speed limits or rapid acceleration/deceleration." (SSTS focuses on thresholds, while UC specifies unsafe behavior) |
| SSTS defines exit conditions for when the system is turned off, but does not emphasize the scenario where the system becomes temporarily unavailable due to malfunctions, as stated in UC. | "The system enters a disabled state and logs an error message, ceasing real-time monitoring until repaired." (SSTS focuses on malfunction but does not highlight temporary unavailability to the driver) |
| SSTS provides a general summary of driving behavior, but lacks explicit reference to "behavior improvement areas" as the UC requires. | "A detailed report is generated on a weekly basis, summarizing the driver's overall performance and including specific recommendations for improvement." (SSTS does not mention actionable improvement areas as clearly as UC) |
| SSTS mentions the use of sensors and calibration without emphasizing "individual vehicle calibration," as stated in the UC. | "The system requires an active driver profile to ensure personalized feedback and data collection." (SSTS mentions system calibration but does not emphasize individual vehicle calibration) |
