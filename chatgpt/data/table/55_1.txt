| UC specifies that the BSD system provides alerts only during lane changes, but SSTS does not emphasize lane change as the exclusive trigger for alerts. | "The system is triggered when the driver manually engages the turn signal to indicate a lane change, triggering the system to check the blind spot." |
| UC mentions that the system provides "escalating warnings" if the lane change is unsafe, but SSTS only refers to a "continuous or louder" alert without specifying escalation due to unsafe lane changes. | "If the driver attempts to change lanes while an object is detected in the blind spot, the system may escalate the alert with a continuous or louder sound." |
| UC states that the system deactivates during low-speed maneuvers like parking, but SSTS specifies deactivation occurs below 20 km/h, without explicitly mentioning parking. | "The BSD system deactivates when the vehicle speed drops below the threshold (e.g., 20 km/h), typically during low-speed maneuvers such as parking." |
| UC implies the system should always provide a warning during blind spot detection, but SSTS mentions that the system deactivates if there is no detected object in the blind spot, without stressing continuous monitoring. | "The system will deactivate the alerts and reset once the lane change is completed or if the detected object no longer poses a risk." |
| UC requires that the system notify the driver immediately in case of a sensor failure, but SSTS only mentions an error message or warning light. | "If the system detects a malfunction, such as a blocked sensor or system failure, it will display an error message on the vehicle’s dashboard or a warning light to alert the driver." |
