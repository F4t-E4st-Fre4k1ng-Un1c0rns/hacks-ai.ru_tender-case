| SSTS lacks clarity on providing personalized driving tips for fuel efficiency and overall safety, as specified in UC. | "The system generates a detailed performance report, showing the driver’s driving patterns, areas for improvement, and specific recommendations to encourage safer and more efficient driving." |
| UC requires long-term tracking of driving habits for ongoing feedback, but SSTS does not explicitly state tracking long-term trends. | "The system stores long-term driving data, tracking improvements over time, and allows the driver to view historical performance trends to monitor progress." |
| SSTS does not mention adaptive thresholds for feedback based on individual driving habits, which UC specifies. | "The system triggers real-time feedback when predefined thresholds for unsafe behaviors (such as excessive speed, harsh braking, or aggressive acceleration) are exceeded." |
| UC specifies real-time actionable tips, but SSTS only mentions auditory and visual feedback without explicit mention of in-the-moment tips during driving. | "The system provides immediate, real-time feedback during the drive through visual alerts and auditory notifications on the vehicle's infotainment display." |
| SSTS does not clearly specify the handling of sensor failures and their impact on long-term data collection and feedback, while UC requires system reset and error management. | "If the system detects a critical behavior (e.g., repeated unsafe driving), it triggers an alert recommending further action, such as driver training or a system reset." |
