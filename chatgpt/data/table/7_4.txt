| SSTS does not fully capture the requirement for continuous hazard detection in all driving modes, including low-speed or parking maneuvers. | "The system is activated when the vehicle transitions from 'Park' to 'Drive' or 'Reverse' mode, ensuring hazard detection is available in all driving situations, including parking." |
| The SSTS lacks a specification for calibrating sensors to ensure consistent and accurate hazard detection, as required by the UC. | "The system must remain operational and able to detect hazards at low speeds (e.g., during parking or in traffic) as well as at higher speeds on highways." |
| SSTS does not provide details on monitoring and detecting secondary hazards during an alert phase, which is included in the UC. | "The system continuously monitors the environment even after an alert has been issued, ensuring that secondary hazards or changes in the environment do not go undetected." |
| SSTS mentions only basic feedback (visual, auditory, and haptic) but does not differentiate alerts based on hazard severity as the UC specifies. | "Alerts will vary in priority based on the severity of the hazard. Critical alerts (e.g., a pedestrian suddenly entering the vehicle’s path) trigger urgent responses, while non-imminent risks (e.g., a slowly approaching vehicle) will generate lower-priority alerts." |
| The SSTS does not specify that the system should be capable of continuous hazard detection, even when no immediate threat is present, as required by the UC. | "The system must be calibrated for accurate hazard detection across various driving environments and conditions (e.g., urban, rural, highway)." |
