| The UC specifies that the system provides multiple alert levels (e.g., visual, auditory, and haptic) with clear escalation, but SSTS does not specify the detailed escalation of alert levels. | "Upon detecting distraction, the system issues an initial alert to the driver, which may include one or more of the following methods: Visual: Flashing lights on the dashboard or instrument cluster. Auditory: A warning chime or voice prompt. Haptic: Vibration in the steering wheel or seat." |
| UC requires the system to take automatic corrective actions such as reducing speed or pulling over in response to continued distraction, but SSTS only mentions reducing speed without describing a full emergency stop or pulling over. | "In cases of severe or prolonged distraction, the system may trigger safety mitigation measures, such as: Gradually reducing the vehicle’s speed." |
| The UC highlights ongoing monitoring during the entire trip after distraction is detected, but SSTS does not explicitly mention continuous monitoring after alerts are given. | "The system logs each event of distraction, along with the alert levels and any mitigation actions taken, for later review by the driver or service personnel." |
| UC specifies that the system should provide fallback mechanisms for sensor failure or errors, but SSTS does not describe a fallback system in case of sensor failure, only noting that the system will not activate. | "The system will automatically reset and resume monitoring once the vehicle is stopped and restarted, or after a successful acknowledgment by the driver." |
| The UC mentions that the system will activate alerts based on both visual and behavioral cues of distraction, including head nodding, but SSTS does not explicitly mention detecting head nodding. | "The system continuously monitors the driver’s behavior, specifically focusing on eye movements, head position, and facial cues." |
| UC specifies that the system must ensure the driver has acknowledged the alerts before stopping corrective actions, but SSTS does not mention an explicit driver acknowledgment process for certain actions like speed reduction or emergency stop. | "If the driver fails to acknowledge or respond to the initial alert, the system escalates the alert by increasing the intensity or frequency of feedback." |
| UC requires a comprehensive system reset after any significant action (e.g., emergency stop or manual intervention), but SSTS does not explicitly outline this in terms of a full reset after emergency measures are taken. | "The system will automatically reset and resume monitoring once the vehicle is stopped and restarted, or after a successful acknowledgment by the driver." |
