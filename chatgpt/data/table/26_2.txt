| SSTS focuses primarily on vehicle operation but lacks detailed emphasis on user experience or feedback, which is more emphasized in the UC. | "The mobile app sends a start or stop command to the vehicle’s engine control system." |
| SSTS lacks specific mention of app interface behavior or feedback for each action, which is required in the UC. | "The mobile app displays a notification to the user confirming the action, such as 'Engine Started Successfully' or 'Engine Stopped Successfully.'" |
| SSTS does not provide detailed failure modes or alternative actions for user interaction when the system fails, as outlined in the UC. | "If the action was unsuccessful (e.g., due to network failure), the app informs the user with an appropriate error message, such as 'Unable to connect to the vehicle. Please check your connection and try again.'" |
| The UC specifies that the app should provide status updates of the vehicle engine's operation, but the SSTS does not emphasize this post-action transparency. | "The vehicle’s system logs the remote engine action for future reference or troubleshooting." |
| SSTS does not fully detail the requirements for vehicle security systems to permit remote engine control, while the UC emphasizes this. | "The vehicle’s security systems must permit remote activation and deactivation of the engine to prevent unauthorized use." |
| SSTS mentions network connectivity as a trigger, but UC stresses the importance of maintaining consistent communication range or connection, which is not fully detailed in SSTS. | "The vehicle is within an operational communication range of the mobile app (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi)." |
| SSTS does not specify the need for user notification in case of successful remote engine start/stop with greater granularity, which is highlighted in UC. | "The mobile app displays a confirmation message such as 'Engine Started' or 'Engine Stopped.'" |
