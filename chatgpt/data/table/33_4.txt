| The SSTS lacks reference to mobile app integration for remote access, which is included in the UC. | "The vehicle’s software and hardware must be updated to the latest security patches and configurations for optimal authentication." |
| The UC specifies integration with both mobile apps and key fobs, but the SSTS only mentions key fobs and mobile devices without clarity on app-based remote access control. | "The vehicle system must be synchronized with the user’s mobile app or key fob, ensuring proper communication and access control." |
| The SSTS does not clearly describe the ignition system's activation after successful authentication, which is required by the UC. | "Upon successful authentication, the system unlocks the vehicle’s doors and prepares the ignition system for operation." |
| The UC mentions detailed logging of authentication attempts, including method, time, and success/failure, while the SSTS provides a more general description of logging. | "The system logs every authentication attempt, including the method used, time of attempt, and whether it was successful or failed, for future review and security auditing." |
| The UC specifies handling multiple failed authentication attempts with specific outcomes, but the SSTS only mentions feedback and retry without detailing lockout or alerting the vehicle owner. | "If multiple failed attempts occur, the system locks the user out for a period and notifies the vehicle owner about the suspicious activity." |
| The SSTS does not mention resetting or reconfiguring authentication settings after repeated failure, which is a required feature in the UC. | "The user or administrator has the option to reset the authentication settings in case of malfunction or unauthorized access attempts." |
