|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not specify verifying additional vehicle conditions like battery status or temperature before engine start, which is implied in the UC. | "The vehicle must be in a state that allows engine start/stop (e.g., in 'Park' mode, doors unlocked, and no safety restrictions)." |
| SSTS lacks specific details on real-time vehicle status updates, such as temperature or battery level after the engine is started or stopped. UC implies this level of detail. | "The app will display a success notification along with real-time status updates (e.g., engine status, battery level)." |
| SSTS does not mention automatic verification for all necessary conditions before triggering the engine start/stop, while UC specifies these conditions should be checked automatically. | "The vehicle must be confirmed to be in a valid state for the command (e.g., in 'Park' mode, doors unlocked, no other safety conditions preventing the action)." |
| SSTS only mentions failure notifications without providing full troubleshooting steps, which are expected in the UC. | "If the command fails due to an unmet condition (e.g., vehicle is in motion, connectivity issue), the app will display an error message and offer troubleshooting steps or recommendations." |
| SSTS does not detail secure disconnection or log-out behavior explicitly after engine start/stop, as required by the UC. | "The app ensures secure disconnection from the vehicle after each interaction, preventing unauthorized access." |
| SSTS does not fully describe the user’s post-interaction behavior, such as viewing the vehicle status or logging out after successful execution, which the UC implies. | "After successful engine start/stop, the app will return to the main vehicle status page or log the user out, depending on their preferences." |
