| UC specifies the automatic adjustment of driving behavior, including hazard lights activation, but SSTS describes it as an optional feature. | "The system may automatically adjust certain vehicle settings (e.g., hazard lights activation), provided the option is configured for such behavior." |
| UC expects the system to provide precise and timely recommendations at all times, but SSTS mentions delays due to external data or sensor issues. | "The system will alert the driver and may disable certain features until the issue is resolved, providing a status update for troubleshooting." |
| UC outlines the system’s ability to continuously provide recommendations without relying on external data, but SSTS requires an internet connection for full functionality. | "A stable internet connection is required for accessing external data sources such as weather reports and traffic updates." |
| UC requires adaptive recommendations in real-time based on road condition changes, but SSTS mentions that the system may not trigger recommendations during sensor malfunctions. | "If there is a failure in the system (e.g., sensor malfunction or loss of external data), the system will alert the driver and may disable certain features until the issue is resolved." |
| UC specifies that the system should always provide reliable, adaptive recommendations, but SSTS does not guarantee this in cases of external data loss or sensor failure. | "Once the issue is resolved, the system resumes regular operations, providing accurate road condition alerts and adaptive recommendations based on current data." |
