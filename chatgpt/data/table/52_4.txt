| The UC specifies that the app should provide real-time data with uninterrupted synchronization, but the SSTS does not guarantee continuous or real-time data syncing. | "The vehicle must be within operational range for communication, either via Bluetooth or an internet connection (when using mobile networks)." |
| The UC indicates that the app should allow detailed user interaction with data (e.g., filtering, exporting), but the SSTS does not specify these capabilities. | "Real-time vehicle health data is displayed on the app’s main dashboard, including key metrics like battery level, tire pressure, engine status, and overall vehicle performance." |
| The UC specifies actionable steps for alerts, including scheduling services and contacting support, but the SSTS only mentions triggering notifications without elaborating on actionable steps. | "Notifications are triggered for any detected issues, such as low tire pressure, engine faults, or irregular battery performance. These alerts will include actionable steps such as checking the issue, scheduling a service, or contacting support." |
| The UC emphasizes robust error handling for connectivity issues, while the SSTS only briefly mentions connectivity troubleshooting. | "If the vehicle encounters a critical issue (e.g., battery failure, engine overheating), the app logs the issue and provides the user with next steps, including service scheduling or emergency recommendations." |
| The UC requires data backup and storage to be clarified, while the SSTS only generally mentions data storage without specifying the mechanism (cloud, local, user preference). | "Upon logging out or exiting the app, the user’s session is securely closed, and all relevant vehicle data is stored or backed up according to the user's preferences, ensuring that data is available for future reference." |
| The UC defines specific user interaction scenarios in case of failure (e.g., reconnecting, permissions check), but the SSTS lacks specific detail on handling those failures in the process. | "The system will ensure that the app retries connection until successfully re-established or user intervention occurs." |
