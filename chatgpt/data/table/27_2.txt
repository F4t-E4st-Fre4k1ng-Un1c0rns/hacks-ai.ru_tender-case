|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not specify integration with the vehicle’s battery management system for optimizing charging duration based on battery status, as required by the UC. | *"The system is capable of processing payments for charging services, sending notifications about session updates, and generating receipts."* |
| SSTS does not mention user preferences for selecting charging stations, such as distance, speed, or pricing, which is implied in the UC. | *"The system verifies the availability of the selected charging station and provides the user with an estimated start time for the session."* |
| SSTS lacks detailed instructions on handling failure scenarios, like network outages or payment issues, as required by the UC. | *"If there are any issues, such as station unavailability or network problems, the system notifies the user and offers alternatives or rescheduling options."* |
| SSTS does not specify how the system handles user notifications about charging status or session interruptions, unlike the UC which mentions comprehensive notifications. | *"During the charging session, the user receives real-time updates about the charging progress, including remaining time and energy input."* |
| SSTS does not include the specific post-session updates to the user’s account or charging history, which the UC requires. | *"The charging station returns to an idle state after the charging process ends. The user’s charging history and payment information are updated in the user account."* |
