| The UC specifies "automatic detection of available parking spaces," but the SSTS only mentions scanning for suitable spaces without explicit mention of automation. | "The system will automatically scan the surrounding area to detect available parking spaces, both parallel and perpendicular." |
| UC requires both parallel and perpendicular parking capabilities, but the SSTS does not clearly specify both parking types, focusing primarily on scanning for spaces. | "Once activated, the system will automatically scan the surrounding area to detect available parking spaces, both parallel and perpendicular." |
| The UC requires the system to autonomously guide the vehicle into a parking space with full control over steering, braking, and acceleration, while the SSTS doesn't fully clarify if the system adjusts to obstacles in real-time. | "The system continuously monitors the environment for obstacles and adjusts the vehicle’s movement in real-time to ensure safe and accurate parking." |
| UC specifies that the system should notify the driver once parking is completed, while the SSTS only mentions disengagement without confirming feedback to the driver. | "The system will notify the driver once the vehicle is properly parked and the process is complete." |
| UC requires the system to notify the driver when an issue occurs (e.g., sensor malfunction), while the SSTS only specifies disengagement without elaborating on notifications or guidance for issues. | "In case of a malfunction or obstacle detection failure, the system will alert the driver with a warning, advising them to disable the system and park manually." |
| The UC specifies the system should be able to function in any parking environment, but the SSTS introduces specific limitations like proximity range (up to 10 meters). | "The system will only engage if a parking space is identified as being suitable for the vehicle, considering both size and clearances." |
