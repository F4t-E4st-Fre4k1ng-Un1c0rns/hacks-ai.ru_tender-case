| UC focuses on high-level user interactions and business outcomes, while SSTS delves into technical details not covered in the UC. | "The system will assist the driver in parking the vehicle in various types of parking spaces, such as parallel, perpendicular, and angled spaces." |
| UC specifies that the system should provide user feedback in a clear manner; SSTS does not fully address the type of feedback given during parking execution. | "The system will provide visual feedback to the user, displaying the parking progress on the vehicle's screen." |
| SSTS includes conditions where the system fails to perform, such as environmental issues, which the UC does not mention. | "Environmental conditions should be optimal, with clear visibility for cameras and unobstructed sensors (no heavy rain, snow, or dirt on sensors)." |
| UC emphasizes the completion of the task by the system, while SSTS provides additional details on failure handling that might not align with UC’s expected outcomes. | "If external conditions such as blocked sensors or inadequate parking space are detected, the system will inform the driver and disable automatic parking, requiring manual intervention." |
| UC expects a general task completion notification, but SSTS specifies technical aspects of the system’s operation that are not required in the UC. | "Upon successful completion, the vehicle will be parked accurately in the designated space, with the system providing a confirmation alert to the user." |
| The UC assumes that the system is compliant with regulatory and safety standards without explicitly stating compliance levels, but the SSTS addresses non-compliance explicitly. | "However, the system may not always function optimally in certain environments, such as areas with poor visibility or when sensors are obstructed." |
| SSTS includes very specific enabling conditions, such as battery percentage and sensor clarity, which are not mentioned in the UC. | "The vehicle's battery level must be above 20% for the system to engage." |
| UC focuses on the overall driver experience, while SSTS details the system’s interaction with the vehicle's hardware, which might be overly technical for UC’s scope. | "The system is activated by the user pressing a button or issuing a voice command to start the automated parking process." |
