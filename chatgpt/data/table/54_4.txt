| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The UC specifies that the system must provide **real-time alerts** for traffic signs, while the SSTS does not clarify if alerts are always real-time, particularly in terms of timing accuracy. | "The system will generate immediate visual and/or audible notifications to inform the driver of the relevant sign." |
| UC emphasizes **regular updates** for new or changed traffic signs, but the SSTS does not specify how often or under what circumstances updates will be applied. | "The system must be regularly updated through over-the-air (OTA) software updates to ensure recognition of new or modified traffic signs, changes in traffic laws, and improvements in detection algorithms." |
| UC requires that the system differentiate between **critical and informational signs**, but the SSTS lacks detail on how the urgency of the alert is prioritized for different types of signs. | "The system will differentiate between critical signs (e.g., stop, yield, red light cameras) and informational signs (e.g., speed limits, cautionary warnings), adjusting the urgency and type of the alerts accordingly." |
| UC specifies a **minimum detection range** for traffic signs, but the SSTS only mentions detection range without a specific value for how far ahead the system can recognize a sign. | "The system will trigger when a traffic sign enters the sensor’s field of view, and the sign meets the required recognition criteria (clear visibility, correct positioning, etc.)." |
| UC requires **manual fallback options** if the system encounters a malfunction, but the SSTS does not mention this contingency. | "If the system encounters a sign it cannot identify or categorize, it will trigger an error alert to the driver, indicating a possible malfunction or sign recognition failure." |
| The UC specifies that the system should not deactivate prematurely when traffic signs are present, while the SSTS mentions the system **exiting** after passing a sign or when out of range, which could lead to premature deactivation. | "The system will exit when the vehicle passes the detected traffic sign or the sign moves out of the detection range of the sensors (minimum detection range: 100 meters)." |
| The UC calls for alerts when signs "require immediate action," but the SSTS does not explicitly indicate how the system prioritizes immediate action for critical signs like stop signs. | "For signs that require immediate action, such as stop signs or speed limits, the system will generate an audible alert to immediately notify the driver, accompanied by a visual alert on the dashboard." |
| UC requires the system to handle **poor visibility** conditions, but the SSTS does not specify the exact conditions under which the system should enter a **reduced functionality mode**. | "If the system determines that the current road conditions or visibility are too poor for accurate sign recognition (e.g., severe fog or snow), it will enter a reduced functionality mode where sign recognition is paused, and the driver is notified of this limitation." |
