| UC expects automatic detection of vehicle malfunctions to trigger roadside assistance, while SSTS only allows manual initiation by the user. | "The user activates the roadside assistance feature manually, either by pressing the 'Roadside Assistance' button on the vehicle interface or by issuing a voice command to the vehicle." |
| UC assumes seamless connectivity without the need for an active account or service area verification, but SSTS requires these conditions. | "The user must have an active account with a compatible roadside assistance provider." |
| UC mentions providing real-time status updates in all scenarios, while SSTS allows for status update gaps when there is no network connection. | "If there is no connection available, the system will notify the user of the failure and prompt for manual intervention (e.g., phone call or waiting for network recovery)." |
| UC expects full automation for seamless operation, but SSTS only triggers assistance upon user input. | "The system detects that the user requires roadside assistance, based on user input or action." |
| UC requires that the system should always offer alternative assistance methods when communication fails, while SSTS only provides a manual fallback without fully automated solutions. | "The system fails to establish a connection due to network issues, and the user is prompted with alternative actions such as calling for help or waiting for network recovery." |
