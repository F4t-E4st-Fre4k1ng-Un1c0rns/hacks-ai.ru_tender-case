| SSTS does not specify a clear and proactive approach for hazard detection at low-risk levels, contrary to the UC’s requirement for early warnings. | "A warning is triggered if an object is detected within 10 meters and the system calculates a high probability of collision." |
| SSTS mentions automatic braking, but does not clearly state the requirement for steering intervention in all collision scenarios, as per the UC. | "If a collision risk is detected, the system triggers both an auditory and visual warning to alert the driver. If the system determines that a collision is imminent, it automatically engages corrective actions, including braking, to reduce vehicle speed and avoid impact." |
| SSTS specifies system deactivation when the vehicle comes to a stop, but UC requires the system to be continuously operational without interruption during low-speed maneuvers. | "The system deactivates automatically when the vehicle comes to a complete stop (e.g., at a traffic light or in heavy traffic) and will re-activate once the vehicle begins moving again." |
| SSTS does not fully align with UC’s requirement for dynamic calibration while in motion, as SSTS only mentions calibration at vehicle startup and under specific conditions. | "The system must be activated each time the vehicle is started, with full functionality being available once the vehicle reaches a minimum speed of 5 km/h." |
| SSTS does not provide sufficient clarity on failure handling procedures, specifically the notification of precise sensor failures and recovery steps, as required by UC. | "If a malfunction occurs (e.g., sensor failure), the system provides a clear notification on the vehicle’s dashboard, indicating the specific issue and recommending the driver to visit the service center for further diagnosis and repair." |
