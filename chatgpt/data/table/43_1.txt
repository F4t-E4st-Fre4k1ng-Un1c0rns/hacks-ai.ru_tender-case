| SSTS does not clearly specify real-time feedback for fuel efficiency recommendations during trips, as outlined in the UC. | "The system will periodically (e.g., weekly) trigger automated recommendations based on accumulated data about the user's driving habits." |
| SSTS lacks detailed information about vehicle telemetry compatibility, which is required by the UC. | "The vehicle must be equipped with a compatible onboard telematics system that tracks energy consumption and driving behavior in real-time." |
| UC mentions immediate feedback on driving behavior, whereas SSTS only refers to periodic recommendations without real-time adjustments. | "The system will periodically (e.g., weekly) trigger automated recommendations..." |
| SSTS does not describe how user profile data is continuously saved across sessions, as the UC implies. | "All performance data, including efficiency reports and recommendations, is automatically saved to the user’s profile for future reference." |
| The UC mentions customer support interaction in case of failure, while the SSTS lacks specific failure handling or notification processes. | "If the system encounters a technical issue (e.g., loss of connection to vehicle telemetry), the sub-System will display a clear error message and log the issue for resolution." |
| The UC implies real-time feedback on energy consumption, but SSTS limits this to summarized reports after trips. | "The system generates detailed efficiency reports after each trip and delivers periodic insights on how users can improve their fuel efficiency." |
| UC requires detailed and continuous feedback on efficiency improvements, while SSTS only provides a summary after trips. | "At the end of each trip, the system provides a summary that includes the total energy consumed, the range achieved, and the efficiency compared to previous trips." |
