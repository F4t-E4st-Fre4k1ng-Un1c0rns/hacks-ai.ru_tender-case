| UC specifies that recommendations should be based on a variety of factors, including "mood" and "real-time driving conditions," while SSTS does not explicitly mention these factors. | "The system dynamically adjusts recommendations based on real-time user preferences, driving conditions, environmental factors, and the user's mood." (SSTS mentions mood and driving conditions but lacks clarity on mood being a direct recommendation factor.) |
| UC specifies that the system should react to environmental conditions like speed, location, and weather in real-time; SSTS does not mention weather or mood explicitly as influencing recommendations. | "The system has access to environmental data such as location, speed, and time of day through vehicle sensors and connected services." (Weather data is not mentioned.) |
| UC requires the system to update its recommendations in real time based on ongoing user interaction and context changes (e.g., highway vs. city driving); SSTS does not clearly indicate this level of dynamic real-time adjustment. | "The system adjusts the volume, genre, or type of content dynamically in response to user feedback or changes in driving conditions (e.g., increasing energy of the music if the car accelerates)." (While it mentions adjustment, the description does not fully capture the dynamic nature described in UC.) |
| UC mentions fallback mechanisms for when external services fail, but SSTS does not adequately cover failure handling or fallbacks in detail. | "If the system encounters technical issues (e.g., network failure), it defaults to a backup media option and informs the user of the issue (e.g., 'Unable to access streaming service. Playing your default playlist instead')." (Fallback mechanisms are mentioned but lack depth and clarity compared to UC’s detailed fallback requirements.) |
| UC requires that the system be able to provide personalized recommendations based on real-time environmental conditions such as weather, speed, and mood; SSTS does not mention weather as a factor. | "The system has access to environmental data such as location, speed, and time of day through vehicle sensors and connected services." (Weather is omitted from environmental data considerations.) |
| UC emphasizes the importance of a seamless user experience where recommendations are always relevant and continuously refined; SSTS mentions updates but lacks clarity on continuous refinement. | "User preferences and feedback are logged, and the system uses this data to refine future suggestions." (Does not clarify how suggestions continuously adapt or improve in real time as required by UC.) |
| UC specifies that system preferences should reflect user feedback and adjust dynamically during each session; SSTS mentions feedback logging but not the immediate adjustment during the same session. | "User preferences and feedback are logged, and the system uses this data to refine future suggestions." (The immediate real-time dynamic adjustments as specified in the UC are not mentioned.) |
