| The SSTS does not address the compatibility with non-standard or older vehicle models, which is explicitly required by the UC. | "The charging station’s software must be up-to-date to support communication with a wide range of vehicle models, including new and older versions." |
| UC specifies that the system must provide a complete charging process with no power interruptions, whereas the SSTS mentions potential failures without clear handling methods. | "If the vehicle is moved or there is an interruption in power supply, the system stops the charging session and alerts the user." |
| The UC requires real-time monitoring and adjustment of power based on the vehicle’s battery state, whereas the SSTS only states that power adjustment occurs without details on continuous monitoring. | "The system automatically begins the charging process, adjusting power output based on the vehicle's current battery level and charging needs." |
| The UC specifies that the system should automatically terminate the session once the vehicle is fully charged, but the SSTS does not mention automatic termination in the event of charging failure or disconnection. | "Once charging is complete, the system safely terminates the session and notifies the user that the vehicle is fully charged." |
| The UC requires a fault-free charging process with no communication failures, whereas the SSTS only mentions error handling when faults occur but lacks preventive measures. | "The system detects no system faults and verifies stable power supply from the grid." |
| The UC emphasizes consistent calibration for varying environmental factors, but the SSTS does not specify how the system adjusts to environmental conditions. | *No relevant quotation found in SSTS regarding automatic calibration to environmental factors.* |
| The UC requires the system to log all data, including interruptions, while the SSTS only logs successful charging sessions without mentioning failures or interruptions. | "The charging session data, including power transferred and session duration, is logged for maintenance and future analysis." |
