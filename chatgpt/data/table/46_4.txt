| UC specifies automatic, continuous synchronization across multiple registered devices, while SSTS limits synchronization to manual initiation and only one device at a time. | “Only one user device can connect to the vehicle system at a time… Synchronization can only be initiated by the user through the vehicle’s settings menu.” |
| UC requires seamless multi-device synchronization with cloud-based or Wi-Fi connectivity; SSTS only supports Bluetooth connectivity, excluding cloud options. | “Synchronization functionality is limited to Bluetooth connectivity; cloud-based and Wi-Fi synchronization are unavailable.” |
| UC expects the system to prompt users to sync updated preferences automatically; SSTS requires users to manually access the settings menu for synchronization. | “The system does not support automatic prompts or notifications to suggest synchronization when new preferences are detected.” |
| UC mandates retention of user profiles and settings for easy access and continuity in subsequent sessions, while SSTS does not store profiles beyond the current session. | “User profiles and preferences are not saved for future sessions; only the current session’s settings are applied.” |
| UC specifies that prior settings should reload when a different user profile is selected; SSTS requires manual reconfiguration each time a profile is changed. | “If a different user profile is selected, the previously saved settings will not automatically reload, requiring manual configuration for each user.” |
