| SSTS does not specify the inclusion of detailed parking data such as pricing or time limits, which is mentioned in the UC. | "The system offers detailed information about each parking space, including distance from the vehicle, availability status, and any relevant restrictions (e.g., pricing or time limits)." |
| UC expects the system to handle dynamic updates and provide continuous guidance for parking space availability, but SSTS lacks emphasis on this dynamic aspect. | "Real-time notifications regarding the status of selected parking spots, including any updates (e.g., spot becomes unavailable)." |
| The UC specifies that the user should receive turn-by-turn directions based on real-time status, but SSTS only mentions directions to the parking space without explicitly linking them to real-time parking updates. | "Directions to the selected parking space with turn-by-turn navigation, continuously updated based on real-time traffic and parking space status." |
| The UC emphasizes that parking event details (location, time, status) should be logged for future reference, but the SSTS only mentions confirmation once the user parks, not event logging. | "The system records the parking event, including location, time, and status, for user reference and future tracking." |
| SSTS does not mention the possibility of automatic system initiation for parking searches beyond manual input or proximity detection. | "The sub-system is activated automatically when the user starts their journey towards a destination where parking is required." |
| UC mentions the user being notified of unavailable parking spaces, while SSTS focuses only on providing alternatives without specific notifications about unavailability. | "If no parking spots are available, the system provides a message notifying the user and suggests alternatives or displays the nearest available parking lot." |
