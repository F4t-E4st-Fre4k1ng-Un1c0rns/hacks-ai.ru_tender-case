| UC emphasizes the system's user-centered design and ease of interaction, whereas SSTS describes technical functionality without user experience focus. | "The Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance) is designed to support the driver in automating the parking process." (SSTS) |
| UC describes the system as "fully functional" for the user, while SSTS mentions partial compliance, indicating limitations in certain conditions. | "While the system performs well in most conditions, certain edge cases and environmental factors can limit its functionality, resulting in partial compliance with the full set of intended features." (SSTS) |
| UC focuses on user actions such as selecting a parking space and confirming the parking process, while SSTS describes technical triggers based on sensor inputs. | "The driver initiates the parking process by selecting a suitable parking space on the infotainment display or via voice command." (UC) vs. "The system detects an available parking space via its sensors as the vehicle approaches." (SSTS) |
| UC assumes successful parking unless the system fails, while SSTS outlines possible error handling scenarios. | "The system provides feedback to the driver if the parking process is unsuccessful." (UC) vs. "In case of a failure (e.g., sensor malfunction or obstacle detection), the system will display an error message and suggest manual intervention." (SSTS) |
| UC assumes the system will always park the vehicle successfully, but SSTS mentions situations where the system might not function as expected. | "The system takes full control of the vehicle’s steering, throttle, and braking once parking is initiated." (UC) vs. "The system may require the driver to manually intervene and complete the parking process." (SSTS) |
| UC provides an optimistic view of the system's completion, while SSTS discusses exit conditions for error scenarios. | "Once the parking maneuver is successfully completed, the system notifies the driver with a visual and audible confirmation that the parking is finished." (UC) vs. "The parking assist feature will automatically disengage when the parking maneuver is finished or when the system detects that further action is needed from the driver." (SSTS) |
