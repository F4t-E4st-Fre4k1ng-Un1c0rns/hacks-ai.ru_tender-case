| SSTS does not specify the automatic correction of vehicle alignment during parking, which is mentioned in the UC. | "The system automatically controls the steering, acceleration, and braking, guiding the vehicle into the parking spot." |
| UC specifies that the system should automatically correct the vehicle's position when misaligned, while SSTS does not provide this feature explicitly. | "The system automatically controls the steering, acceleration, and braking, guiding the vehicle into the parking spot." |
| SSTS lacks a detailed description of environmental conditions that may interfere with system operation, unlike the UC which mentions clear environment requirements. | "The vehicle’s environment must be clear of significant obstacles that might interfere with sensor readings (e.g., large objects, nearby cars, or severe weather conditions)." |
| SSTS does not define the specific range at which the system should trigger, while the UC implies a clear proximity requirement. | "The vehicle must be within proximity to the parking space for the system to activate (usually within 1 to 3 meters of the spot)." |
| SSTS does not explicitly mention the user action of pressing the brake pedal to stop the car after parking, which is detailed in the UC. | "The system provides feedback to the driver via visual and auditory alerts, notifying them of the progress and completion of the parking process." |
| SSTS does not provide detailed error handling, such as notifying the user of a malfunction during the parking process, as required in the UC. | "In case of a malfunction or failure, the system exits parking mode automatically and alerts the driver, prompting them to check the vehicle’s sensors or system status for issues." |
