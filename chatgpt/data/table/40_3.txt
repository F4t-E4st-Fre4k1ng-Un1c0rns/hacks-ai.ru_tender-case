|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS mentions compatibility with most toll and parking systems, but UC requires seamless integration with all systems. | "The system supports automated payment but has limited compatibility with certain legacy toll systems or outdated parking infrastructure, requiring manual payment methods in some cases." |
| UC specifies that the system should automatically detect toll or parking infrastructure without user intervention, but SSTS mentions manual intervention when automatic detection fails. | "The system may also be triggered when the user manually selects the 'Payment' option in the vehicle's dashboard interface, in cases where automatic detection fails." |
| UC requires instant and seamless payment processing with immediate barrier operation, while SSTS mentions possible delays due to connectivity or compatibility issues. | "While payment is processed in most cases, there are occasional delays in processing due to communication issues with the payment gateway or infrastructure, leading to slower barrier lifts or failed transactions." |
| UC requires the system to always provide a clear transaction receipt, but SSTS states that receipt generation may not be consistent across all transactions. | "Additionally, some vehicles might not always offer a clear digital receipt for every transaction, leading to potential user dissatisfaction." |
| SSTS lacks clarity on ensuring that failed payments are logged and processed properly, as required by UC. | "The system logs the failure for later review." |
| SSTS does not mention specific communication protocols for all toll and parking systems, which are outlined in the UC. | "The vehicle’s system must support the integration of standard communication protocols used by toll and parking systems, such as RFID, mobile payment APIs, or toll collection standards." |
| UC specifies that the system should be linked to an active user account for automated payments, while SSTS does not explicitly mention linking to a user account for payment processing. | "The system must be linked to an active user payment account (credit/debit card, digital wallet, or prepaid account), allowing for automated payment processing." |
