| SSTS limits voice command recognition to a predefined set, whereas the UC expects full flexibility in recognizing various commands. | "The voice control system supports a limited set of predefined commands and may not fully understand complex, customized commands or regional accents." |
| UC expects the system to provide consistent verbal feedback for all settings adjustments, but SSTS only guarantees verbal feedback for certain settings. | "Verbal feedback is only available for certain settings (e.g., seat position, climate), while other settings (e.g., lighting adjustments) may only provide visual confirmation." |
| UC requires the system to work reliably in all environments, but SSTS acknowledges limitations in noisy or complex environments. | "The system may struggle to process voice commands in noisy environments (e.g., high-speed driving, background conversations) and may require the user to repeat commands." |
| UC expects full support for advanced customization (e.g., multiple settings adjustments simultaneously), whereas SSTS mentions limited support for such cases. | "More complex adjustments (e.g., simultaneous seat adjustment with HVAC settings, or multi-stage lighting preferences) are not fully supported or might require manual intervention." |
| UC mandates the availability of all supported features at all times, but SSTS highlights the potential unavailability of certain features. | "Some features, like lighting or more intricate infotainment settings, may be unavailable or fail to respond correctly due to technical limitations or integration issues with the vehicle’s systems." |
