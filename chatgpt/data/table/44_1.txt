|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC specifies that the system should automatically reset without user intervention, but the SSTS describes the user being notified in recovery mode, which implies some level of user interaction is required. | "If the reset fails, the system enters a recovery mode, providing basic functionality such as navigation or audio, and the user is notified of the issue." |
| UC mentions "error logging" as part of the automatic reset process, while the SSTS includes error logging only in case of reset failure, which is inconsistent with UC. | "Error logs are generated for diagnostic purposes, recording the reset attempt and failure if applicable." |
| UC describes that recovery mode provides "minimal functionality while awaiting further assistance," but the SSTS specifies "basic functionality" without clarification on the scope of minimal functions. | "If the reset fails, the system enters a recovery mode, providing basic functionality such as navigation or audio." |
| UC requires that the reset process restores all functionality within seconds, but SSTS doesn’t specify the duration for recovery mode activation if the reset fails. | "The system enters recovery mode, providing basic functionality such as navigation or audio." |
| UC mentions a predefined timeout period for interaction failure, but SSTS does not specify the exact duration of this timeout. | "The system fails to receive user input or interaction within a predefined timeout period (e.g., 30 seconds of unresponsiveness)." |
