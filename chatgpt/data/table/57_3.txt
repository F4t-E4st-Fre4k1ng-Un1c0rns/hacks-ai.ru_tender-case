|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The UC specifies immediate activation of the evacuation system, but SSTS allows for possible delays due to system failures or sensor issues. | "The system may not always react within the expected timeframe due to sensor or software glitches, which deviates from the underpinning contract's expectation of immediate activation." |
| UC requires full and automatic unlocking of all doors and windows, while the SSTS allows for potential failure in unlocking all doors and windows. | "The system might not always trigger the evacuation sequence in the expected timeframe due to hardware/software incompatibilities or sensor issues." |
| UC requires full activation of emergency lighting, but SSTS allows for partial functionality or failure of emergency lighting. | "Emergency lighting may not always activate in full capacity (e.g., illuminating escape routes), depending on the vehicle's power system or firmware version." |
| UC expects full operational evacuation guidance (visual or voice assistance), while SSTS mentions limited functionality or non-availability in some cases. | "The evacuation guidance (voice or visual assistance) may not be fully operational in all conditions, and manual intervention may be needed for occupants who need extra help to exit the vehicle." |
| UC specifies complete post-event data logging of evacuation events, while SSTS allows for the possibility of no logging in case of system failure. | "Full data logging of the evacuation event (successful or failed) may not be available in case of system malfunction." |
