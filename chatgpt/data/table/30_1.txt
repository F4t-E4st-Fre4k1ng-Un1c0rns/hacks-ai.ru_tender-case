| The UC specifies that the diagnostic session should end smoothly, while the SSTS allows for potential interruptions or failure without addressing a smooth exit process. | "In cases where the diagnostic session cannot be completed due to technical issues (e.g., connectivity failure), the system will exit the session and notify the user of the problem." |
| The UC mentions that the vehicle’s diagnostic data should be transmitted completely, but the SSTS acknowledges that incomplete data transmission may occur due to hardware/software limitations. | "Some vehicles might not send complete diagnostic data due to incomplete sensor readings or faulty communication, leading to a gap in output data." |
| The UC emphasizes that the system should support both automatic and user-initiated diagnostics with no gaps, while the SSTS introduces potential data transmission failures that could prevent full diagnostics. | "The system is triggered by automatic error detection or user-initiated requests, but in some cases, these may not fully transmit due to system or connectivity issues." |
| The UC implies consistent data delivery for issue resolution, whereas the SSTS mentions the possibility of gaps in data due to vehicle software versioning. | "Some vehicles may lack full diagnostic reporting capabilities if not up-to-date with the latest software versions." |
| The UC outlines a seamless interaction for diagnostics, while the SSTS allows for disruption or manual intervention if automatic processes fail. | "The system will exit the session and notify the user of the problem... guiding them to alternative support methods." |
