| UC specifies that the system should provide alerts for both *imminent* and *potential* hazards, while SSTS primarily focuses on *imminent* hazards. | "The system will alert the driver through audio, visual, and haptic feedback if a hazard is detected..." |
| UC mentions the need for proactive warnings for future potential hazards like slippery surfaces or sharp curves, but SSTS only details alerts for currently detected hazards. | "The system will alert the driver through audio, visual, and haptic feedback if a hazard is detected..." |
| The UC indicates the system should notify the driver in the case of sensor failure and enter a reduced functionality mode, but SSTS lacks clarity on how the system responds when the hazard detection system is unavailable. | "In case of system failure (e.g., sensor malfunction), the system will notify the driver and enter a degraded mode with limited hazard detection capabilities." |
| UC specifies that hazard data should be used for continuous improvement of the system, but SSTS only mentions logging hazard data without detailing its use for optimization. | "Hazard data (type, location, and severity) will be logged for future system analysis and optimization." |
| UC requires that the driver be given sufficient time to react to alerts, but SSTS does not address the urgency of reaction time in the case of imminent hazards. | "Upon detecting a hazard, the system will trigger one or more of the following alerts to the driver..." |
