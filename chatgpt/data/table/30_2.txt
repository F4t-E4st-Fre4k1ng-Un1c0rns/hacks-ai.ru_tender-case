| SSTS lacks clarity on whether non-critical issues trigger automatic diagnostics. UC specifies that automatic diagnostics should trigger for system issues like battery or tire pressure. | "The vehicle detects a critical error (e.g., engine failure, brake malfunction) and automatically triggers the diagnostic system for immediate assessment." |
| SSTS suggests diagnostics can be performed when the vehicle is powered on but does not clarify that full diagnostic scans require the vehicle to be in the "Ready" state, as required in the UC. | "The vehicle must be in a 'Ready' state or powered on, depending on the diagnostic features being accessed." |
| SSTS mentions "real-time alerts for critical issues," but UC specifies that alerts should be provided for both critical and non-critical issues (e.g., low tire pressure). | "Real-time alerts for critical issues that require immediate attention, such as engine or brake malfunctions." |
| SSTS implies manual initiation of diagnostics is the primary method, whereas UC specifies automatic diagnostics for detected issues such as tire pressure or battery alerts. | "The user manually selects the 'Remote Diagnostics' option through the vehicle's mobile app or infotainment system." |
| SSTS provides limited fallback actions for connectivity failure, whereas UC specifies a clearer path for contacting support when diagnostics cannot be completed due to connectivity issues. | "If a connectivity issue prevents the system from completing the diagnostic check, the system exits with a failure message and suggests the user try again later or contact support." |
| SSTS is unclear on whether all software updates are handled remotely, whereas UC specifies the need for OTA (Over-The-Air) updates for critical issues. | "The subsystem enables remote software updates when necessary." |
