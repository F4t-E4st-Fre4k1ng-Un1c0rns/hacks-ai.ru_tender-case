| The UC specifies automatic profile detection, but the SSTS allows for manual user profile selection. | "The system is activated when the user logs into their profile via the vehicle’s interface or manually initiates the seat adjustment function." |
| UC assumes the system will automatically adjust to the saved position for any profile, while the SSTS allows for manual adjustment without automatic recall. | "If no user profile is saved, the system will prompt the user to save the current seat position after adjustment." |
| UC mentions multi-user support for different profiles, but the SSTS does not fully clarify that multiple profiles can be used simultaneously or automatically loaded. | "The system also supports the creation and storage of multiple user profiles, ensuring that each user can recall their settings independently." |
| The UC expects seamless operation with memory recall every time, while the SSTS only ensures functionality when the system is powered on and fully initialized. | "The vehicle must be powered on and the system fully operational." |
| UC implies automatic seat adjustments upon entering the vehicle, but the SSTS requires user input to trigger profile-based adjustments. | "The system is activated when the user logs into their profile via the vehicle’s interface or manually initiates the seat adjustment function." |
| UC states that the seat position will always be recalled upon entry, while the SSTS does not ensure the seat will return to the saved position if the system is not initialized or powered. | "The system exits the seat adjustment process once the seat reaches the requested position and the operation is complete." |
