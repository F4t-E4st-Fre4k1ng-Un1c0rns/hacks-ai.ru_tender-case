|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not specify the requirement for regional tolling and parking service compatibility in as much detail as the UC, which includes all regional systems. | "The system must be compatible with the specific toll and parking service providers in the region of operation." |
| The UC requires that the system provides audio confirmation for successful payments, which is not explicitly mentioned in the SSTS. | "Once the user enters a toll zone or parking area, the system will detect the toll/parking charge and notify the user through the infotainment screen, requesting confirmation for payment." |
| SSTS lacks clarity on user account setup and verification before using the system, whereas UC mentions this explicitly as a requirement. | "The user must have an active, verified payment method linked to the vehicle’s payment account (e.g., credit card, mobile wallet, or account-based system)." |
| The UC requires the system to store payment history and allow users to access it, which is not explicitly addressed in the SSTS. | "A digital receipt will be generated and stored within the system for future reference." |
| The UC specifies that users should be notified if the system fails, with alternative actions provided, while the SSTS only mentions a generic error message without specific fallback steps. | "If the payment is unsuccessful, the system will notify the user with an error message and offer instructions for manual payment (if necessary)." |
| The UC requires an explicit startup check or readiness confirmation before entering a toll/parking area, while the SSTS only mentions functional system readiness. | "The system must have the necessary software and firmware versions installed, enabling communication with external toll and parking systems and ensuring smooth payment transactions." |
