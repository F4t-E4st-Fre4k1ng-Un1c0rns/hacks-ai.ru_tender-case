| The UC specifies that the system supports all parking types (parallel, angle, perpendicular), but the SSTS does not explicitly mention the support for angle and perpendicular parking. | "The system enables the vehicle to autonomously park in various types of parking spaces, including parallel, angle, and perpendicular parking." |
| The UC requires detailed user feedback during the parking process, such as a progress bar and specific auditory signals, but the SSTS only mentions "real-time updates" and "auditory signals" without detailing these elements. | "The system provides real-time feedback to the user via visual cues on the dashboard display (such as a progress bar) and auditory signals (beeping)." |
| The UC mentions that the system will notify the user when the vehicle is "fully parked," but the SSTS does not include such specific feedback upon completion. | "The system will signal the user with a visual and auditory alert to confirm that the parking is finished, and the vehicle is correctly positioned within the space." |
| The UC mentions that the system should handle parking in tight spaces with high precision, but the SSTS does not clearly define "tight space" handling. | "The parking area must be clear of major obstacles such as other vehicles or objects that could impede the parking process." |
| The UC specifies that the system will guide the user with progress notifications and step-by-step feedback, but the SSTS only mentions real-time updates and alerts without specific progress indicators. | "The system will guide the vehicle into the selected parking space by controlling steering, acceleration, and braking while providing real-time feedback." |
| The UC includes a requirement for "full system failure warnings," whereas the SSTS does not provide a detailed breakdown of error handling beyond stopping the system. | "If the system detects any issue during the parking process (such as insufficient space, sensor malfunction, or obstacles in the way), the system will stop and notify the user through visual and auditory alerts." |
