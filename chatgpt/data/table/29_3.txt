| The UC requires both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi full compatibility, but the SSTS only mentions Bluetooth and has limitations with Wi-Fi. | "The user’s smartphone must be Bluetooth-enabled and connected to the vehicle via either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi." |
| The UC specifies automatic detection and transition between the in-car system and smartphone, while the SSTS requires manual initiation by the user. | "The user selects the option to switch from the in-car system to the smartphone app or vice versa, using a manual control on the interface." |
| The UC calls for near-instantaneous synchronization between platforms, but the SSTS mentions possible delays in synchronization. | "This feature aims to provide seamless operation, although there may be occasional delays or connectivity challenges based on device compatibility and system performance." |
| UC expects smooth handling of disconnections with minimal disruption, whereas the SSTS describes potential brief delays in response after disconnection. | "The system will automatically revert to using the in-car interface or the smartphone app independently if the connection is lost, though this may involve brief delays in system responsiveness." |
| The UC specifies full control of all vehicle features (media, navigation, climate) from both platforms, but the SSTS limits some features to only the in-car interface. | "The system facilitates a continuous experience, allowing users to access vehicle functions on the in-car interface or via the smartphone app with minimal interruption."  (Implied limitation on climate control via smartphone app). |
