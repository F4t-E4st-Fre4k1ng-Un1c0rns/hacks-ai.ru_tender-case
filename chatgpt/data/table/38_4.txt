| The UC specifies the system should provide personalized feedback like "Gentle braking recommended," but the SSTS only mentions generic alerts. | "Real-time visual and auditory alerts will be displayed on the dashboard to indicate safe and unsafe driving behaviors." |
| UC requires the system to remain active throughout the trip, while the SSTS suggests that the system may deactivate if a fault occurs. | "The system must be capable of functioning continuously throughout the driving trip, ensuring uninterrupted operation unless a fault occurs." |
| UC specifies the system should track specific behaviors like acceleration, braking, and cornering and provide suggestions, but SSTS lacks detail on specific behavior-based triggers for feedback. | "It activates upon detection of key driving events such as acceleration, braking, sharp turns, or speeding, ensuring real-time feedback for unsafe or non-optimal behavior." |
| The UC states that the system provides a report at the end of the trip, but the SSTS does not make it clear that the report is automatically generated and available to the driver. | "A trip summary report will be generated at the end of each driving session, providing insights into the driver’s behavior, highlighting areas for improvement, and offering eco-driving suggestions." |
| UC requires the system to store and track behavior over time, but the SSTS does not clarify if data is consistently tracked for progress. | "The system will store driving data securely, making it available for the driver’s review in future trips or via a connected mobile application." |
