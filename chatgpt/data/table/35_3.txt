| The UC specifies head position monitoring as a requirement, but the SSTS only mentions eye-tracking and steering behavior for fatigue detection. | "The system uses a combination of facial recognition technology, eye-tracking sensors, head position monitoring, and steering behavior analysis to assess the driver's alertness." |
| UC requires that the system be calibrated according to the driver’s specific settings and preferences, but the SSTS only mentions automatic calibration without detailing customization options. | "The system must be enabled through the vehicle’s settings menu, which allows the driver to adjust sensitivity and set personal preferences for alerts." |
| UC states the system should notify the vehicle’s central system when fatigue is detected, but the SSTS does not mention such notification or integration. | "The system logs the alert event, including data on the driver’s behavior, time of alert, and driving conditions at the time of detection." |
| UC expects the system to suggest breaks with detailed recommendations for the driver to take action, but the SSTS provides only basic alerts without detailed guidance for breaks. | "A recommendation will be shown on the dashboard, suggesting that the driver take a break at the nearest safe location." |
| UC requires continuous monitoring during the entire driving session, while SSTS specifies sensor activation only when the vehicle is in motion and the driver is seated. | "The vehicle must be in motion and the driver must be seated in the driver’s seat with the seatbelt fastened for the system to be operational." |
| UC mentions that the system should continue alerting the driver if no action is taken, but the SSTS does not specify that alerts are issued continuously or repeatedly. | "If the driver does not respond to the initial alert, additional reminders will be issued until the driver either acknowledges the alert or takes corrective action, such as stopping for a rest." |
