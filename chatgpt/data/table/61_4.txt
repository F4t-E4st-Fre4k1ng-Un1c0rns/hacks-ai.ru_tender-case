|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS suggests the system may revert to the last known route in case of traffic data unavailability, while the UC expects real-time notifications and re-routing based on current conditions. | "If the system determines that no viable alternative route exists, it will notify the user of the issue and suggest waiting for traffic conditions to improve, or the user can manually adjust the route if desired." |
| SSTS does not clearly specify that the system must constantly monitor traffic conditions in real time as the UC requires. | "The system will automatically calculate and provide an updated route to avoid disruptions and reduce travel time, with real-time guidance displayed on the navigation screen." |
| SSTS allows for a default route if no viable alternative is found, but UC emphasizes continuous optimization and the need to avoid congestion or disruptions. | "In cases where re-routing is not possible, the system will default to the last known route or provide the original route if no disruptions are detected." |
| SSTS mentions that the system can revert to the default route but does not explicitly notify the user that the system is no longer considering real-time traffic data, which is a requirement in the UC. | "The system will notify the user of any failure to retrieve real-time traffic data and will either revert to the last available route or request manual input from the user until the connection is restored." |
| SSTS lacks a detailed description of how the system will maintain consistent performance without a stable connection, which is a requirement in the UC. | "The system must have access to reliable real-time traffic data, which requires an active internet connection or cellular data for traffic updates." |
