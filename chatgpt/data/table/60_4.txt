| The SSTS does not mention automatic environmental adjustments like night-time or low-light conditions, which were part of the UC. | "Environmental factors, such as low light conditions or nighttime driving, may trigger auto-adjustment to pre-set lighting modes like 'Relax' or 'Focus.'" |
| The SSTS lacks specific integration with other in-car systems (e.g., climate or navigation systems) as required by the UC. | *No relevant quotation found in SSTS regarding integration with other in-car systems.* |
| The SSTS does not detail a backup or recovery mechanism in case of system failure, unlike the UC which mentions a fallback scenario. | "If the system detects a malfunction, it will trigger a fallback mode or error message, prompting the user to take corrective action (e.g., rebooting the system or contacting support)." |
| The SSTS does not include a clear notification of success or failure after changes are applied, which is a feature described in the UC. | "Confirmation of the new lighting settings is displayed on the touchscreen interface with a visual cue, indicating the changes have been successfully applied." |
| The SSTS does not specify error message instructions or user guidance for recovery after system failure, unlike the UC. | "In case of a malfunction, the system provides an error message or visual indicator of failure, guiding the user to troubleshoot or contact support." |
