|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC expects automatic diagnostics based on vehicle anomalies, but SSTS only mentions manual or error-triggered scans. | "A vehicle error message (e.g., warning lights or fault codes on the dashboard) automatically triggers a recommendation for a diagnostic scan." |
| UC requires the system to handle partial sensor failures, but SSTS doesn't address how to manage incomplete data from non-functional sensors. | "The vehicle’s sensors and internal systems must be fully operational and accessible by the remote diagnostic platform." |
| UC outlines fallback mechanisms for data communication failures, but SSTS lacks a clear protocol for degraded communication. | "An active, stable internet connection (via cellular data or Wi-Fi) is required for full functionality of the remote diagnostics system." |
| UC specifies detailed, actionable diagnostic reports, but SSTS mentions general recommendations that lack specificity. | "The system generates a detailed report outlining the condition of the vehicle, including any issues detected with sensors, components, or software." |
| UC expects the system to notify users of unsuccessful diagnostics, but SSTS does not include failure notifications for incomplete scans. | "If the system encounters an issue during the diagnostic process (e.g., network failure, communication error), the user will receive a clear failure notification." |
| UC includes automatic maintenance reminders, but SSTS does not clearly define how preventive maintenance is triggered or handled. | "The system will also trigger a diagnostic scan automatically at predefined intervals or based on accumulated mileage to ensure preventive maintenance checks are performed regularly." |
