|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not fully specify that users should receive actionable recommendations or follow-up actions for maintenance or charging adjustments, unlike UC. | "The system ensures that users are informed of both minor and critical issues with sufficient detail to allow them to take appropriate action." |
| SSTS lacks clarity on persistent alert notifications for unresolved issues, which is emphasized in the UC. | "After the user acknowledges an alert, the system marks the issue as resolved unless the problem persists, in which case the alert reappears until fully addressed." |
| SSTS does not explicitly state that alerts will persist until resolved by the user, while UC requires ongoing alerts for unresolved issues. | "The system generates an alert notification that includes the nature of the issue (e.g., battery degradation, overheating) and recommended actions." |
| The UC specifies an active account requirement for accessing the remote monitoring system, but SSTS does not clearly emphasize this as a mandatory condition. | "The vehicle must be connected to the remote monitoring platform via a secure, authenticated user account." |
| SSTS does not address the need for a full range of notifications, both minor and critical, as per the UC’s requirement for detailed actionable notifications. | "The system provides real-time data on key battery parameters such as state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), and estimated range." |
| SSTS does not allow immediate user-triggered access to battery data during non-charging or non-driving periods, as implied in the UC. | "The system automatically retrieves data when the vehicle starts charging or is in motion, continuously updating the battery status." |
