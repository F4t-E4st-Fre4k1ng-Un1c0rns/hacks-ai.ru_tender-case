| The UC specifies automatic system activation when the vehicle starts moving, while the SSTS requires manual activation. | "The system should be integrated into the vehicle’s software and activated automatically once the vehicle starts moving (e.g., above 10 km/h)." (SSTS does not state automatic activation, it requires manual activation by the driver.) |
| The UC includes automatic interventions like emergency braking or steering adjustments, but the SSTS only mentions alerts without detailing automatic interventions. | "Upon detecting a hazard, the system provides a visual alert on the dashboard and an auditory warning to the driver to inform them of the potential danger." |
| The UC specifies the system should react to specific hazards like pedestrians and braking vehicles, while the SSTS mentions "predefined hazards" and "change in driving environment," which is vague. | "Hazard detection is triggered by the appearance of potential risks such as pedestrians, other vehicles, sudden braking, sharp turns, or dangerous road conditions." (SSTS does not specify specific hazards like pedestrians or braking vehicles explicitly as UC does.) |
| The UC mentions that the system should handle failures like sensor obstruction, while the SSTS only mentions cleaning sensors without explaining the handling of failures. | "The system will also be triggered if the sensors detect obstructions or if the sensor lenses are dirty, requiring maintenance or cleaning." (Does not address full failure modes, only obstruction/maintenance.) |
| The UC expects the system to deactivate after the hazard is no longer present or manually disengaged, but the SSTS only mentions deactivation after a speed threshold. | "The system will exit hazard detection mode when the vehicle slows down to below the activation speed (e.g., below 10 km/h) or when the detected hazard is no longer present." (Does not mention manual deactivation as in UC.) |
