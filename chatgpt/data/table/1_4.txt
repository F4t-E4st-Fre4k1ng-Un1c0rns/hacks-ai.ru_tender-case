| The UC focuses on the user experience with seamless operation, while the SSTS describes technical specifics that include failure points and system errors. | "The V2V subsystem will exit if it detects a loss of communication with surrounding vehicles or if no vehicles are in range for data exchange." |
| The UC assumes the system is fully operational, while the SSTS mentions potential communication failures and external factors affecting system performance. | "The system will exit if it detects a loss of communication with surrounding vehicles or if no vehicles are in range for data exchange." |
| The UC highlights user safety and communication effectiveness, while the SSTS mentions issues like lack of encryption and system instability under non-compliant conditions. | "If a critical system error occurs (e.g., communication failure, hardware malfunction), the system will exit and display an error message indicating the need for maintenance or software update." |
| The UC expects consistent and timely alerts, whereas the SSTS mentions delays and data inaccuracies under non-compliant conditions. | "The system transmits real-time data to the vehicle’s dashboard, displaying information on surrounding vehicles’ speeds, locations, and potential hazards." |
| The UC specifies an ideal scenario of V2V working with other vehicles and infrastructure, while the SSTS describes environmental factors (e.g., signal interference) that can impede performance. | "The communication range must be at least 300 meters, with an unobstructed line of sight to ensure optimal performance." |
| The UC assumes that the V2V system is always enabled, but the SSTS outlines user controls to enable or disable the feature. | "The system must be activated by default when the vehicle is powered on, and users can enable or disable V2V through the vehicle settings." |
| The UC does not mention specific software or hardware version requirements, but the SSTS outlines the need for up-to-date software and compatible communication modules. | "Vehicles must be equipped with a compatible V2V communication module that supports the latest communication protocols, including DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications) or C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything)." |
