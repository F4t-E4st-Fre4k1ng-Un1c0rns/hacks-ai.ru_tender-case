| The UC specifies a broader range of user settings (e.g., "infotainment preferences" and "driving mode"), while the SSTS only mentions basic settings like "seat position" and "climate control." | "The system loads the user’s profile, adjusting vehicle settings such as seat position, mirror position, climate control, and driving mode to the user’s predefined preferences." |
| The UC requires specific error handling when a profile cannot be loaded, including the creation of a new profile or retrying the current one, but the SSTS lacks clarity on error scenarios and does not mention profile creation in case of an error. | "If the user’s profile cannot be loaded (e.g., due to an error), the system prompts the user to either retry loading the profile, create a new profile, or use default settings." |
| The UC specifies that the system should notify the user about necessary updates or errors, but the SSTS does not mention alerts about system updates or profile issues beyond saving the settings. | "In the event of an error or system malfunction, the system alerts the user to potential issues and offers the option to retry or use default settings." |
| The UC emphasizes that profile settings are saved upon exit, but the SSTS does not explicitly mention that profile settings are saved at the end of the session unless changes are made. | "If a new profile is created or an existing profile is updated, the system confirms the changes and saves them for future use." |
| The UC includes specific details about switching between multiple user profiles seamlessly, while the SSTS does not clarify how users can easily switch profiles beyond profile selection. | "The system detects a linked user profile via Bluetooth, key fob, or biometric recognition when the user attempts to access the vehicle." |
