|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not specify that the system needs to handle both Bluetooth and internet connectivity as required by UC. | "The mobile application must be installed on a compatible smartphone and set up with user authentication (e.g., PIN code, biometric authentication)." |
| UC specifies that the app must provide immediate feedback for the lock/unlock actions, whereas SSTS only mentions sending confirmation notifications after actions are performed. | "Upon receiving an 'Unlock' command, the system sends a signal to the vehicle, unlocking the doors, and a confirmation notification is displayed on the user’s smartphone." |
| UC requires automatic logout or session closure after an action, but SSTS allows manual closure or requires user interaction to log out. | "The mobile app automatically logs out or closes the session after a successful transaction, ensuring the system is secure and no unauthorized actions can occur." |
| UC requires a transaction log to be generated for every action, but SSTS does not guarantee transaction logging in case of failed actions or errors. | "A log of the transaction is recorded for security and audit purposes, capturing details such as time, vehicle status, and user ID." |
| UC mandates troubleshooting instructions for every error, while SSTS only provides basic error notifications without guaranteed troubleshooting guidance. | "If an error occurs during execution (e.g., connection failure), the system provides the user with a clear error message and troubleshooting steps, if applicable." |
| SSTS does not mention vehicle battery charge level affecting the remote operation, which is a requirement in the UC. | "The vehicle’s battery must have a minimum charge level to enable the locking/unlocking operations." |
| UC expects more detailed fallback behavior when connection issues occur, whereas SSTS does not clearly define the system’s behavior in case of prolonged connectivity failure. | "If connectivity is lost during the execution, the system attempts to reconnect, and if it remains unsuccessful, the app provides an error message indicating that the vehicle cannot be controlled remotely at the moment." |
