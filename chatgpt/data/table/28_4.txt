| The SSTS lacks specific mention of all possible road hazards like potholes, debris, and road surface irregularities. | "The system provides real-time monitoring and alerting of road conditions to the driver. It detects and analyzes road hazards such as wet surfaces, icy patches, construction zones, and debris." |
| The SSTS does not specify that the system should automatically adjust vehicle performance (e.g., traction control or braking) in response to road conditions, which is required in the UC. | "The system then provides adaptive recommendations to optimize driving behavior, including speed adjustments, lane changes, and the activation of vehicle safety features such as traction control or automatic braking when necessary." |
| SSTS does not clearly outline the requirement for continuous, dynamic calibration of the system for specific regional road conditions, which is specified in the UC. | "The system must be calibrated for the region of operation, considering local weather patterns, road types, and traffic conditions." |
| The SSTS does not clearly define the threshold for triggering road condition alerts, such as the specific parameters (e.g., temperature or moisture levels) that would automatically prompt an alert as required in the UC. | "The system continuously monitors road conditions and will trigger an alert whenever hazardous conditions are detected (e.g., slippery roads, potholes, construction zones)." |
| The SSTS does not emphasize that the system should provide ongoing, dynamic feedback until the user exits the hazardous area, contrary to the UC’s requirement. | "Once the system has delivered its final alert or recommendation in response to detected road conditions, it stops providing updates unless new hazardous conditions are identified during the trip." |
| The SSTS does not clearly define the expected functionality of the system when connectivity or sensors fail, leaving gaps compared to the UC’s detailed handling of failures. | "If the system loses connectivity to external data sources or experiences a sensor malfunction, an error message will be triggered to inform the user of a temporary limitation in functionality." |
