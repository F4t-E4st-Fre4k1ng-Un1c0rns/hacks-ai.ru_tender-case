| SSTS mentions that health data may be unavailable due to connectivity issues, whereas UC expects consistent availability of health data. | "The system may be partially integrated with the company’s mobile app or dashboard interface, but user access could be limited due to connectivity issues or lack of full synchronization." |
| SSTS mentions "periodic health checks" without specifying exact intervals, whereas UC expects precise report frequency options. | "Trigger conditions include regular health check intervals set by the user (which can be erratic due to connectivity issues)..." |
| SSTS specifies that some reports may be incomplete or contain errors, while UC expects complete and accurate reports. | "The output may not be as complete or timely as required. Some reports might lack detailed diagnostics or contain errors due to incomplete data capture." |
| SSTS fails to mention automatic reattempts to generate reports after a failure, whereas UC expects automated retries and alerts for errors. | "The system may occasionally fail to deliver a full, actionable diagnostic report or may miss some performance metrics such as tire pressure or minor system alerts." |
| SSTS suggests that users may have to manually retry report generation if there’s an error, whereas UC anticipates automatic retries. | "The system notifies Bob of the failure, and a customer support representative is automatically contacted via phone or email to assist with troubleshooting and resolution." |
| SSTS does not ensure that the system provides clear, detailed remediation steps after a critical issue is detected, while UC expects full guidance for next steps. | "The system may not provide full remediation options or a detailed resolution path, as required by the underpinning contract." |
| SSTS does not specify that all critical issues will generate immediate notifications, contrary to UC's expectation of proactive alerts. | "Automated notifications may sometimes be delayed or inaccurate, especially if connectivity with the vehicle is weak or interrupted, leading to users not receiving timely alerts." |
