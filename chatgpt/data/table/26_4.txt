| SSTS does not specify the requirement for a "luxury electric vehicle," which is implied in the UC. | "The vehicle must be equipped with the Remote Engine Start/Stop system..." |
| SSTS lacks a clear mention of specific vehicle conditions (e.g., battery level, safety systems) that must be met for remote engine control, which is required in the UC. | "The vehicle must have sufficient battery power for remote operation, and all safety systems (e.g., immobilizer, security) must be functional." |
| The enabling condition for mobile app updates and compatibility is not addressed in SSTS, whereas UC implies the app must be up to date. | "The mobile application must be installed and configured correctly on the user’s smartphone, with the latest updates to support compatibility with the vehicle's engine control system." |
| SSTS does not define the exact methods for mobile app connectivity (e.g., mobile network, Bluetooth), whereas the UC implies specific connection ranges. | "The mobile app and vehicle must be within operational range (mobile network or Bluetooth), ensuring a reliable communication link between the two devices." |
| SSTS does not mention any contingency for network failures or other error handling in the case of engine start/stop failure, as specified in the UC. | "If the action cannot be completed (e.g., vehicle out of range, insufficient battery), the app will display an error message indicating the issue and suggesting possible actions..." |
| SSTS does not specify post-interaction return to "safe mode" or "standby" after engine start/stop, which is implied in the UC. | "The system ensures that the vehicle enters a safe mode if any issues are detected during the process (e.g., low battery, unsafe vehicle condition)." |
