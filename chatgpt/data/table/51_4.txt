| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC requires real-time and accurate speed limit data at all times, whereas SSTS mentions the possibility of outdated or incomplete data. | "The system relies on offline map data which may not be up-to-date with current traffic laws or local changes in speed limits." |
| UC specifies that the system should trigger alerts when exceeding the speed limit by any amount, while SSTS allows a 10 km/h tolerance before triggering alerts. | "The system triggers when the vehicle exceeds a predefined speed limit threshold, which may be up to 10 km/h over the local speed limit." |
| UC mandates full compliance monitoring and logging of all violations, while SSTS suggests that the system may fail to log some instances of non-compliance. | "The compliance monitoring output is inconsistent; at times, the system might not log events of speeding violations or provide compliance data for future reference." |
| UC requires the system to use up-to-date speed limit data continuously; however, SSTS only uses cached or outdated data in case of GPS failure. | "If the system cannot retrieve real-time speed limit data, it will provide a notification to the driver, explaining the potential limitations and advising caution." |
| UC requires system alerts when the vehicle exceeds the speed limit by 3 km/h, while SSTS allows a buffer of up to 10 km/h for triggering alerts. | "The system triggers when the vehicle exceeds the predefined speed limit threshold, which may be up to 10 km/h over the local speed limit." |
| UC requires a continuous, real-time connection for accurate data; SSTS specifies that alerts can still be triggered based on cached or outdated data in some cases. | "The system will trigger an alert if the vehicle exceeds the speed limit regardless of whether GPS signal is stable, using cached speed limit data as a backup when necessary." |
| UC specifies that speed limit data must be synchronized in real-time with cloud services, while SSTS only mentions cloud services as a backup. | "The system is connected to cloud services for real-time updates to speed limit data." |
| UC requires clear exit conditions for system failure, but SSTS is less specific about exit scenarios in case of critical system issues. | "The system stops providing alerts once the vehicle’s speed is reduced to within 3 km/h of the local speed limit or when the vehicle has reached the speed limit." |
