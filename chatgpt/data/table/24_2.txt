| The UC specifies that the system must provide clear user interaction with alerts, but SSTS lacks detailed user interaction instructions. | "If an abnormal condition is detected (e.g., low tire pressure or high tire temperature), the system outputs a warning to the user, displaying the affected tire and the specific issue (e.g., 'Low Pressure in Front Left Tire')." |
| The UC mentions logging issues for future reference, but the SSTS does not specifically mention logging or tracking tire issues over time. | "After resolving any issues, the system will automatically resume normal monitoring and display of tire conditions." |
| UC expects clear troubleshooting steps in case of errors, but SSTS provides minimal guidance on user actions for resolving system errors. | "In the event of a malfunction or sensor disconnection, the system outputs an error message advising the user to check sensor connections or consult the vehicle manual for troubleshooting." |
| The UC states the system should allow users to acknowledge alerts, whereas the SSTS does not specifically mention the ability to acknowledge or dismiss alerts. | "The system outputs a warning to the user, displaying the affected tire and the specific issue (e.g., 'Low Pressure in Front Left Tire')." |
| UC requires that the system operates continuously and provides updates, but SSTS lacks specific mention of the frequency of real-time updates. | "The system continuously monitors and updates the tire pressure and temperature readings, displaying the real-time data on the vehicle's dashboard." |
