| UC emphasizes the user-facing features and interaction, while SSTS delves into the technical details of system functionality. | *UC Example:* "The system will enhance the user experience by remembering these preferences across multiple sessions." <br> *SSTS Example:* "The system stores user preferences securely in a database, updating the user profile with the latest configuration." |
| UC focuses on a general description of user interaction, whereas SSTS includes specific details on how preferences are stored and retrieved, such as syncing with devices. | *UC Example:* "The system will remember these preferences across multiple sessions." <br> *SSTS Example:* "The system must be connected to the vehicle's internal network to interact with other subsystems (e.g., climate control, seat adjustment)." |
| The UC describes a general error handling approach, but SSTS includes more technical details about error handling and recovery options. | *UC Example:* "If the issue persists, Bob is provided with the option to manually configure basic settings." <br> *SSTS Example:* "If there is a failure in loading or saving preferences, an error message is displayed with troubleshooting steps or options to retry." |
| UC provides a high-level overview of system behavior upon user interaction, whereas SSTS outlines precise technical execution and output expectations. | *UC Example:* "The system will remember the preferences in the future." <br> *SSTS Example:* "The system successfully retrieves and displays the current user preferences when the user accesses the 'User Preferences' menu." |
| SSTS specifies system conditions, such as dependencies on software or hardware configurations, while UC does not. | *SSTS Example:* "The system’s software and firmware must be up-to-date and compliant with the latest security and safety standards." |
| UC describes exit conditions from a user perspective, while SSTS focuses on system-level operations. | *UC Example:* "The system will remember the preferences in the future." <br> *SSTS Example:* "The system transitions to an idle state after preferences are applied or changes are canceled, ready for the next user interaction." |
