|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC requires full integration with the vehicle’s central control system for real-time monitoring and compliance, while SSTS mentions partial integration or standalone operation. | "The system must be connected to a display interface capable of showing speed limit data and alert notifications (e.g., dashboard display or infotainment screen)." |
| UC mandates real-time alerting when the vehicle exceeds the speed limit, but SSTS mentions potential delays in alert generation due to system latency. | "There is a delay in the generation of alerts due to system latency or data processing delays, especially when transitioning between regions with different speed limits." |
| UC specifies immediate GPS-based speed limit notifications, while SSTS mentions reliance on GPS data availability and may default to speed monitoring only when GPS is unavailable. | "The system detects a potential fault in the GPS signal or data feed and switches to a default mode of only monitoring speed without speed limit alerts." |
| UC requires automatic real-time speed limit updates based on current location, whereas SSTS does not specify how often or if speed limit data is updated dynamically. | "The system must be connected to a display interface capable of showing speed limit data and alert notifications (e.g., dashboard display or infotainment screen)." |
| UC expects automated compliance reporting without manual intervention, but SSTS specifies that reports may require manual generation. | "The system generates compliance reports that can be accessed by the driver or fleet manager through the vehicle’s interface or via an external data sync. The report includes details such as time, location, and speed limit compliance." |
| UC demands continuous monitoring without significant gaps in compliance data, while SSTS highlights potential gaps due to GPS signal loss. | "If the GPS signal remains unavailable for an extended period, the system halts speed limit monitoring until the GPS signal is restored." |
