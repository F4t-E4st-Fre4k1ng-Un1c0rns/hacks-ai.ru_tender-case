| UC specifies that the user must manually initiate the diagnostics via the app, whereas SSTS allows for automatic triggering of diagnostics based on vehicle alerts. | "The vehicle’s onboard system detects potential malfunctions or warning signs and automatically generates a diagnostic request." |
| UC requires continuous internet connectivity for remote diagnostics, but SSTS allows for occasional disruptions or failure in connectivity. | "The vehicle must have access to a stable internet connection (via in-car Wi-Fi or mobile data) to enable communication with remote diagnostics services." |
| UC expects a clear user-guided resolution process, while SSTS permits automatic fixes (e.g., system resets or software updates) without user interaction. | "For minor issues, the system may automatically apply fixes, such as resetting a malfunctioning component or updating vehicle software remotely." |
| UC mandates a comprehensive diagnostic report for every session, even when no issues are detected, while SSTS exits without clear action steps in some cases. | "If the diagnostic process cannot be completed due to connectivity issues, the system will exit and prompt the user to check their internet connection. In cases where connectivity cannot be restored, the system will suggest alternative solutions, such as scheduling an in-person service appointment." |
| UC specifies that the user will receive a full diagnostic report and action plan, but SSTS does not clearly define this outcome in cases where no issue is found. | "The diagnostic session concludes once the system has analyzed the vehicle data and generated a diagnostic report. If no issues are detected, the user is notified that the vehicle is functioning within normal parameters." |
