| UC specifies the system should adjust vehicle settings (e.g., seat, mirrors, climate) based on the driver’s profile, but SSTS does not mention this automatic adjustment. | "The vehicle automatically adjusts personalized settings based on the driver’s pre-registered profile (e.g., adjusting the seat, mirrors, and climate controls)." |
| UC requires an alternative authentication method (e.g., PIN code) if biometric recognition fails, while SSTS does not provide a clear alternative method for failure scenarios. | "If authentication fails, the vehicle remains locked, and an error message is generated, prompting the driver to retry or use an alternative authentication method." |
| UC emphasizes that only authorized drivers should be granted access, but SSTS does not clarify whether unauthorized drivers can attempt multiple failed authentication attempts without a backup method. | "If multiple failed attempts occur, the system will exit the process and prompt the driver for a backup authentication method or manual override." |
| UC specifies the system must provide detailed error reports for troubleshooting, whereas SSTS only mentions basic error messages. | "If authentication fails, the vehicle remains locked, and an error message is generated." |
| UC requires the vehicle’s software to be up to date to support the system, but SSTS does not clearly specify requirements for regular updates or calibration checks. | "The vehicle must be equipped with updated software that integrates the Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control sub-System." |
| UC calls for the use of biometric data (e.g., facial recognition) and secure access credentials (e.g., key fob), but SSTS only highlights key fob recognition without stressing biometric data integration. | "The system is activated upon detecting the proximity of the driver or interaction with the access control device." |
