| The UC specifies that reports should be fully automated and generated in real-time, but SSTS mentions delays in report generation and sometimes incomplete automation. | "The system generates automated reports, but the generation may be delayed or not fully automated in some cases." |
| UC requires real-time health monitoring with no delays in data retrieval, while the SSTS notes possible issues with data retrieval due to connectivity or sensor malfunctions. | "Generated reports may sometimes be incomplete or include inaccurate data due to sensor malfunctions or connectivity failures." |
| UC requires the system to always trigger report generation upon critical thresholds being reached, but the SSTS suggests that the system may miss or delay triggering health reports under certain conditions. | "The system may not trigger health report generation consistently upon reaching certain critical thresholds." |
| UC specifies the vehicle should always provide clear and actionable feedback on system failures, whereas SSTS provides vague error messages or lacks clear next steps. | "The system may not provide adequate feedback on how to resolve connectivity issues, instead displaying vague error messages." |
| UC requires the system to always provide a complete and accurate health report, but SSTS mentions that reports may be inaccurate or incomplete due to sensor or connectivity issues. | "The system generates reports that may sometimes be incomplete or include inaccurate data due to sensor malfunctions or connectivity failures." |
| UC expects the system to be fully operational with no dependency on external conditions, while SSTS implies that the system's performance can be affected by external factors such as network connectivity and sensor functionality. | "The system requires network connectivity to transmit health data, and may fail to function correctly if connectivity issues occur." |
