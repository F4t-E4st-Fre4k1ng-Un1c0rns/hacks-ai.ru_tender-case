| SSTS lacks clear specification for automatic unlocking if Bluetooth is disabled or the device is out of range. | "If Bluetooth is disabled or the device is out of range, the system will fail to unlock the vehicle, and an alert will be sent to the user’s phone." |
| UC specifies automatic vehicle entry without user interaction after detection, but SSTS includes user intervention steps (e.g., pressing unlock button or touching the door handle). | "The user touches the vehicle door handle or presses the unlock button, triggering the unlocking process upon successful Bluetooth connection." |
| SSTS specifies fallback notification in case of Bluetooth failure, but does not provide a comprehensive alternative for entry, unlike UC’s keyless access assumption. | "If Bluetooth is not detected, the vehicle remains locked, and the system sends a failure notification to the user." |
| UC expects the vehicle to start automatically after unlocking without additional action, but SSTS states the brake pedal must be engaged to start the vehicle. | "Upon entry and with the brake pedal engaged, the system starts the vehicle automatically without requiring a physical key." |
| SSTS mentions the vehicle can stay unlocked while the user is inside, but does not specify a clear default action for when the user exits, which is implied in the UC. | "The vehicle remains unlocked as long as the user is inside, and the system continuously monitors the Bluetooth connection for any interruptions." |
| UC suggests seamless transition back to locked state when the user exits; SSTS lacks detail on this transition process in case of Bluetooth disconnect. | "If Bluetooth connectivity is lost while the vehicle is running, the system will continue to operate, but the user will be notified of the disconnection." |
| SSTS does not clarify the exact duration for automatic vehicle locking after exit, which is mentioned in the UC. | "The vehicle automatically locks after a set time period (e.g., 30 seconds) or upon detecting the departure of the user’s device from the range." |
