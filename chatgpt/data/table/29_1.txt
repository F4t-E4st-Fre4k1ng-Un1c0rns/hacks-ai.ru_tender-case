| The UC specifies that the transition should be seamless with no interruptions in user experience, while the SSTS does not explicitly address the required user experience quality or performance benchmarks. | "The *Seamless Transition Between In-Car and Smartphone Apps* sub-system allows users to transition seamlessly between their car’s in-built system and the smartphone app without losing data or session continuity." |
| The UC requires automatic synchronization between devices, but the SSTS lacks details on automatic synchronization checks and user notifications in case of synchronization failure. | "The system must check for synchronization between devices upon startup or when transitioning activities to ensure both devices are up to date." |
| The UC specifies a clear user action and response flow in the transition process, while the SSTS only mentions manual and proximity-based triggers, omitting detailed user interaction scenarios. | "The system detects when the user enters or exits the car, triggering the synchronization of active sessions between the car’s system and the smartphone app." |
| The UC emphasizes that the transition should allow for uninterrupted media playback and other activities, but the SSTS does not include specific data types that should be transferred in detail (e.g., media metadata). | "Upon triggering the transition, the system ensures that all active data, such as navigation directions, media content, and vehicle status, is transferred in real-time between the devices without any interruption to the user." |
| The UC mandates that users should always be able to continue their activity after a failed transition, but the SSTS does not guarantee a smooth continuation if the transition fails, only providing an error message. | "If the transition cannot be completed successfully, the user will be informed, and an alternative method of completing the activity (such as using one device exclusively) will be provided." |
| The UC specifies that users should be able to continue their activity across devices without any interruption in the data flow, while the SSTS lacks explicit mention of ensuring smooth continuation on a failed device or session. | "The system will display an error message and provide troubleshooting options. The user can either retry the transition or continue the activity using the current device." |
