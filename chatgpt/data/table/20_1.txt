| The UC specifies that the alert will be presented in a "clear and concise manner," but the SSTS only mentions "visual notification" and "audible signal" without specifying clarity or user-friendly presentation. | "The alert will be accompanied by an optional audible signal, such as a beeping sound, to attract the driver’s attention." |
| UC mentions that external data sources (e.g., live traffic updates) are required for triggering certain alerts, but the SSTS does not clarify the role of external data sources in triggering emergency alerts. | "The vehicle is equipped with external data inputs (e.g., GPS, live traffic data) for enhanced situational awareness." |
| The UC states that the alert should be dismissed or resolved when the driver takes action, but the SSTS lacks detailed feedback on whether the alert is cleared automatically once the driver acknowledges it. | "The alert is cleared from the dashboard once the emergency condition is resolved or the driver dismisses the notification." |
| UC mentions that the system will log the event for future reference, but the SSTS does not clarify the exact event logging details, such as log accessibility or usage. | "The system logs the details of each emergency event, including the type of emergency, the time of occurrence, and the action taken by the driver (acknowledge/dismiss)." |
| The UC specifies that the system will provide "timely notifications" but the SSTS only mentions that the alert will be displayed once a trigger condition is met, without elaborating on the timeliness of the notification. | "When a trigger condition is met, the system immediately displays an emergency alert on the dashboard." |
| The UC highlights the need for a "clear" visual alert but the SSTS does not specify how the visual cues will be clear (e.g., using color coding or varying levels of urgency). | "The alert will include a clear visual icon (e.g., flashing red light or warning symbol) and a text message." |
