| UC specifies the system must reliably detect all objects in the blind spot, while the SSTS notes that the system may miss smaller vehicles or objects in certain conditions. | "The system is designed to reduce the likelihood of side-swipe accidents... However, the system is partially compliant, meaning there may be limitations under specific conditions, such as low visibility, heavy rain, or when detecting smaller objects like motorcycles." |
| UC specifies the system must function effectively in all weather conditions, but the SSTS mentions potential sensor performance issues in adverse weather. | "The system requires functioning sensors... The system operates when the vehicle’s speed exceeds 20 km/h (12 mph) to reduce false detections and ensure the system is only engaged in active driving scenarios." |
| UC outlines a clear system warning method and duration, but the SSTS does not specify how long the visual alert will persist or if the audio alert can be muted in certain situations. | "The warning stops automatically when the detected vehicle leaves the blind spot zone." |
| UC requires a fail-safe alert in case of sensor malfunction, but the SSTS only mentions a generic message without specific instructions for the driver on how to proceed. | "The system will display a message alerting the driver that Blind Spot Detection is unavailable. If possible, a fallback alert will be shown, notifying the driver of the system’s reduced capability." |
| UC expects precise and reliable lane-change detection, whereas the SSTS includes a minimum speed threshold for activation, which may limit its use in low-speed scenarios. | "The system operates when the vehicle’s speed exceeds 20 km/h (12 mph) to reduce false detections and ensure the system is only engaged in active driving scenarios." |
| UC requires that visual and audible alerts are always clearly visible and audible, but the SSTS acknowledges potential issues with alert visibility in certain conditions. | "Visual Output: A warning light or icon will appear on the side mirror or dashboard to indicate the presence of a vehicle in the blind spot. This visual output helps the driver identify the location of the detected object... Audible Output: A warning tone or beep will sound to alert the driver if the system detects a vehicle in the blind spot, particularly if the driver attempts to change lanes with the turn signal engaged." |
| UC assumes full system availability during operation, but the SSTS mentions partial functionality under specific circumstances (e.g., sensor obstruction). | "The system requires clean and properly calibrated sensors for optimal functionality."
