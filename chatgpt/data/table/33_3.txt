| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS allows offline authentication, whereas the UC specifies that real-time authentication is required for all user actions. | "The system requires internet connectivity to perform real-time authentication and validation of user credentials, although offline authentication may be available in certain cases." |
| UC requires multi-factor authentication in all scenarios, while SSTS does not ensure this for every user access attempt. | "The system must support at least one secure authentication method, such as a password, fingerprint recognition, or facial recognition, to verify the identity of users." |
| SSTS does not fully log all actions, particularly for guest or temporary users, contrary to the UC which specifies comprehensive logging for all users. | "The system generates access logs that include the time, date, and actions performed by the authenticated user. These logs are stored for auditing and security monitoring." |
| SSTS does not guarantee immediate locking of the vehicle after user exit, whereas the UC specifies the vehicle must be locked after use. | "The car’s system will automatically lock the car and its features once the user exits or after a predefined inactivity timeout period." |
| SSTS fails to specify any behavior when a suspicious access attempt is detected, whereas the UC mentions alerts and additional verification for suspicious behavior. | "A potential security breach, such as an unusual access attempt, is detected, activating fallback security measures." |
