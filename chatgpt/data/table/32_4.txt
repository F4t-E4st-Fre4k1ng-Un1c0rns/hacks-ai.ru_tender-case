| SSTS specifies that AEBAS only operates effectively in "clear weather" but does not fully meet the UC's expectation of operational functionality in light rain or fog. | "The system is designed to perform optimally in **clear weather** conditions, but it will still provide basic functionality in light rain and fog." |
| SSTS states that AEBAS requires system calibration checks each time the vehicle starts, which could delay immediate availability. UC requires immediate activation upon vehicle startup. | "The system must pass an initial diagnostic and calibration procedure during vehicle startup to ensure accurate sensor readings and effective braking intervention." |
| SSTS limits AEBAS activation to a speed range of **30 km/h to 150 km/h**, whereas UC specifies that it should operate at speeds starting from **5 km/h**. | "The system will operate effectively within the speed range of **30 km/h to 150 km/h**." |
| SSTS only mentions basic functionality in adverse weather conditions but does not ensure full performance in all weather, unlike the UC which expects full operation with potential slight degradation. | "The system may experience reduced performance in extreme weather such as heavy rain, snow, or dense fog." |
| SSTS mentions that AEBAS will only use cameras and radar, but UC specifies that the system should also include LiDAR for full obstacle detection coverage. | "The system relies on a combination of LiDAR, radar, and camera sensors to detect potential obstacles." |
| SSTS states that AEBAS will only provide alerts in certain situations, but UC requires alerts to always be given when emergency braking is engaged. | "The system will provide visual and/or auditory warnings to the driver. A message will appear on the dashboard, and an audible alarm will sound, indicating that emergency braking has been applied." |
| SSTS specifies a fail-safe mode in case of malfunction, but UC requires the system to be always operational unless manually disabled, not allowing for potential inactivation due to error. | "If the system detects a malfunction or failure in the sensors or braking mechanism, it will enter a fail-safe mode and deactivate until repaired." |
