| The UC requires the sub-system to always detect traffic signs and provide alerts under all conditions, but the SSTS notes that performance is impacted by adverse weather and poor visibility. | "Adequate visibility conditions are required, including sufficient lighting and clear road conditions (e.g., not obstructed by weather elements such as fog or heavy rain)." |
| The UC specifies that the system must automatically alert the driver with both visual and auditory cues at all times, but the SSTS suggests that auditory alerts may not always trigger. | "The system may also provide an auditory warning when necessary (e.g., when approaching a stop sign or if the driver exceeds the speed limit)." |
| The UC assumes the system will never require manual reactivation, but the SSTS allows for manual reactivation if the system fails to initialize properly. | "The system is activated automatically when the vehicle is powered on or when the ignition is started... but sometimes requires manual intervention for reactivation if it fails to initialize properly." |
| The UC expects flawless sign recognition at all times, but the SSTS acknowledges that misinterpretations can occur. | "If a sign is misinterpreted or not detected, the system will output an error message or visual indicator alerting the driver to the issue." |
| The UC specifies that the sub-system should never fail to alert in case of a detection failure, but the SSTS indicates failure alerts are triggered under certain conditions, not automatically in every case. | "If the system is unable to detect signs or misinterprets them... the system will trigger a failure alert to notify the driver." |
| The UC requires full compliance under all conditions with no exceptions, while the SSTS mentions failure modes and the need for system shutdown under certain conditions (e.g., sensor failure). | "If the system detects a critical malfunction (e.g., sensor failure), it will enter a fail-safe mode, disabling traffic sign recognition and alerting features until the issue is resolved." |
