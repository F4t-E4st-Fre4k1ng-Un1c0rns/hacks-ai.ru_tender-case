|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC expects immediate and seamless feature execution and feedback, while the SSTS allows for delayed responses and potential connection issues. | "Execution feedback may be delayed due to connectivity or network issues." |
| UC specifies that the system should always provide immediate feedback upon feature execution, but the SSTS does not guarantee this for all features, particularly in the case of weak connections. | "Execution feedback may be delayed due to connectivity or network issues." |
| UC mandates that users should have uninterrupted access to vehicle features after login, whereas the SSTS allows for access failures due to system or network issues. | "The app may not immediately show the updated temperature if the connection is weak." |
| UC requires real-time status updates and immediate feedback, but the SSTS mentions potential delays in status reporting for certain features. | "The app might not immediately show the updated temperature if the connection is weak, contrary to the underpinning contract’s expectation of real-time status updates." |
| UC expects clear and actionable troubleshooting steps in case of errors, while the SSTS only mentions basic error messages and does not provide specific retry mechanisms in all failure scenarios. | "The app notifies the user of the failure and provides suggested troubleshooting steps or prompts the user to retry the action." |
| UC requires the system to ensure full security for all connections, whereas the SSTS only mentions basic communication methods (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular) without specifying detailed security protocols. | "The communication between the vehicle and the app is carried out securely via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular data." |
