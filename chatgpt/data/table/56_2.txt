|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not explicitly include photo and contact data management as part of the cloud storage features, whereas UC mentions them as accessible via the system. | "The user must grant the vehicle appropriate permissions to access and store personal data, including music, contacts, photos, and other media, in the cloud." |
| SSTS mentions synchronization between the vehicle and cloud, but does not specify synchronization across multiple devices as per the UC's requirement. | "The system will synchronize personal data between the vehicle and another device (such as a smartphone or tablet)." |
| SSTS does not mention offline access or fallback functionality in case of connectivity loss, which is implied in the UC. | "If the system is unable to access cloud data (e.g., due to no internet connection), the vehicle will enter offline mode, allowing access to locally stored data until connectivity is restored." |
| SSTS includes error handling but does not fully clarify security measures for session and data clearing post-error, as the UC suggests. | "In the event of a session failure (e.g., loss of internet connection or account error), the system will notify the user of the issue and provide instructions for reconnection or resolution." |
| SSTS specifies logging out to clear data but does not go into detail about securely clearing sensitive data after logout, as the UC requires. | "The user logs out from the infotainment system, securely disconnecting from the cloud storage and clearing all sensitive data from the vehicle’s interface." |
