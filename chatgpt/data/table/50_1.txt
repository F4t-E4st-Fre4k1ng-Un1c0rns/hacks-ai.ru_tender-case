| The UC requires automatic detection of parking session start, while the SSTS mentions the possibility of manual input if session detection fails. | "In cases where automatic detection fails, the user may need to manually enter parking details or use an alternative method to complete the payment." |
| UC specifies that the system should offer multiple payment methods, including parking accounts, but the SSTS indicates potential limitations in payment method support. | "The vehicle must have a valid, active payment method associated with it (e.g., credit card, parking account, mobile payment integration)." |
| The UC emphasizes seamless real-time payment processing, but the SSTS acknowledges potential delays due to connectivity issues. | "A stable and active internet connection is required for real-time communication with the payment gateway and parking facility systems." |
| The UC mandates automatic payment confirmation and receipt delivery, but the SSTS mentions that there could be delays or failures in generating confirmation. | "Once the payment is processed, the system generates a payment receipt which can be saved or sent to the user through email or alternative notification methods." |
| UC requires immediate session closure and fee calculation, while the SSTS states that the session may not always start automatically due to sensor calibration issues. | "The system may experience delays in session initiation or fail to recognize the parking session due to poor sensor calibration or integration issues." |
| UC specifies a smooth, error-free user experience for parking payment, whereas the SSTS highlights multiple failure scenarios where manual intervention is required. | "If there is an error in detecting the vehicle’s entry, processing the payment, or any other failure, the system prompts the user to manually input session details or resolve the issue through alternative means." |
