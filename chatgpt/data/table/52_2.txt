| The UC specifies that real-time monitoring should cover all critical vehicle health parameters, but the SSTS mentions limited parameters like battery and tire pressure, with some others not consistently supported. | "The app displays real-time data on the vehicle's health, including: - Battery charge level and health status (e.g., battery degradation, capacity) - Tire pressure readings and alerts for low pressure." |
| UC requires immediate, consistent alerts for both critical and non-critical issues, but the SSTS mentions delayed or missing alerts for non-critical issues like tire pressure fluctuations. | "Alerts for non-critical issues (e.g., tire pressure fluctuations) are often not triggered unless the user manually refreshes the app." |
| The UC specifies that data refresh should happen at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes), while the SSTS indicates that refresh intervals are inconsistent. | "Data collection upon initial connection is reliable; however, the regular intervals for data refreshment are inconsistent (e.g., sometimes delayed beyond the specified 5 minutes)." |
| UC specifies a smooth exit process with saved data upon closure or disconnection, while the SSTS indicates that data may be lost when the app is abruptly closed. | "In some instances, the app fails to save usage statistics or logs when abruptly closed, leading to data loss." |
| The UC requires detailed error messages and troubleshooting steps for system failures, while the SSTS mentions vague or generic troubleshooting guidance. | "Error messages and troubleshooting suggestions are provided for any detected sensor or system failures, helping users take necessary actions or schedule maintenance." |
| UC specifies the need for secure vehicle pairing and sensor activation, while the SSTS mentions that pairing issues may arise due to firmware or outdated app versions, leading to occasional failures. | "The app and vehicle must be securely paired via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or a cellular connection to allow continuous data synchronization." |
