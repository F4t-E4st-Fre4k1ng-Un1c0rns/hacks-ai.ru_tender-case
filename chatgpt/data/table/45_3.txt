| SSTS does not mention contextual triggers like user mood or vehicle speed, which are described in the UC. | "The system detects changes in the user’s context, such as a change in location, time of day, or weather, which could influence entertainment preferences..." |
| The UC describes the system adapting in real-time to user behavior (e.g., song skips, mood settings), but the SSTS only partially covers this. | "Entertainment content is dynamically adjusted in real-time based on user feedback, such as skipping a song or requesting a new genre." |
| SSTS does not fully address all exit conditions specified in the UC, such as system error handling for connection failures. | "If there is a failure in fetching content from external services (e.g., loss of internet connection), the system will attempt to fall back to offline content or previously stored preferences." |
| SSTS lacks a mention of handling user data in the context of driving modes, which is highlighted in the UC. | "The user must grant permissions for the system to collect and use data related to entertainment preferences, vehicle status, and environmental factors." |
| SSTS omits a detailed description of the fallback behavior when no internet connection is available, whereas the UC expects such behavior. | "If no content is available or no viable recommendations can be made (e.g., in offline mode or with limited data), the system will notify the user and either suggest manual selection or offer an option to adjust settings." |
| SSTS does not specify the system's ability to handle mood-based requests directly, as outlined in the UC. | "The user explicitly requests content based on mood or activity, such as asking the system to 'play relaxing music' or 'find upbeat tunes.'" |
