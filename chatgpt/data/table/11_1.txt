|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The underpinning contract mentions proactive alerts for routine maintenance (e.g., tire pressure, brake wear) but the SSTS primarily addresses fault detection and failure alerts, not routine maintenance. | "The system will trigger an alert if a fault is detected in any of the vehicle’s monitored systems (e.g., tire pressure too low, battery depletion, brake wear, or outdated software)." |
| The underpinning contract specifies that the system should confirm completion of maintenance tasks, while the SSTS does not mention a post-maintenance confirmation to the user. | "Once the maintenance is performed, the system checks the vehicle's systems to confirm resolution of the issue and generates a final report, confirming that all diagnostics are clear." |
| The underpinning contract emphasizes "continuous" connectivity, whereas the SSTS does not specifically address the need for uninterrupted connectivity between the vehicle and the diagnostic system. | "The vehicle must have an active internet connection or another means of maintaining a stable connection with the diagnostic servers for real-time data processing and alerts." |
| The underpinning contract mentions automatic verification after resolving issues, but the SSTS only mentions checking vehicle systems after maintenance without explicitly confirming task completion. | "Once the maintenance is performed, the system checks the vehicle's systems to confirm resolution of the issue and generates a final report, confirming that all diagnostics are clear." |
| The underpinning contract includes a proactive maintenance component, while the SSTS focuses on fault detection without regular checks for potential wear and tear items. | "Routine alerts will be triggered for maintenance needs, such as oil changes, tire rotations, or other scheduled tasks." |
