|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The SSTS does not mention voice recognition as an authentication method, while the UC indicates it could be used for profile identification. | "The system detects the user through the selected authentication method (facial recognition, voice recognition, or manual user ID input)." |
| The SSTS does not explicitly mention automatic profile switching during a mid-journey user switch, as required in the UC. | "The system detects a new user entering the vehicle and switches to their corresponding profile." |
| The SSTS does not clearly state that driving mode adjustments should be automatically saved to the user profile, a requirement outlined in the UC. | "If the user adjusts any settings during the session (e.g., climate control or seat position), the system updates the user’s profile accordingly." |
| The SSTS mentions only a general "error message" when profile retrieval fails, whereas the UC specifies alternative solutions like manual adjustments or default settings. | "If there is a failure in profile retrieval or setting application, the system provides an error message and offers alternative options such as using default settings or manually adjusting preferences." |
| The SSTS does not detail the feedback mechanism (auditory or visual), which is part of the UC's requirement for confirming successful application of settings. | "Feedback is provided to the user confirming that their personalized settings have been applied successfully (via visual or auditory notification)." |
