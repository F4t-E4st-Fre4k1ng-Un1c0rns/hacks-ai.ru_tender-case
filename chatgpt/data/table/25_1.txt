| SSTS mentions "automatic headlight intensity adjustment" but may not fully handle extreme twilight conditions as required in UC. | "The system adjusts headlight intensity in response to ambient light changes, ensuring the vehicle’s lighting is optimized for the current driving conditions, such as transitioning from day to night." |
| UC specifies high beam deactivation for oncoming traffic but SSTS notes the system may fail in certain rare traffic conditions. | "The system will deactivate the high beams when approaching or encountering oncoming traffic." |
| SSTS indicates the system may not optimize Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) in extreme sunlight or reflections, which is a requirement in UC. | "The system optimizes Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) to ensure they are bright enough for visibility without being excessive, adapting to the surrounding light conditions." |
| UC requires automatic beam direction adjustments for all driving scenarios, including curves and rural areas, while SSTS mentions limited capability in rural or curved environments. | "The system responds to specific driving environments, adjusting beam direction to improve visibility, such as when approaching sharp curves or in rural areas." |
| SSTS states the system provides alerts in case of failure but may not provide timely alerts for sensor malfunctions, unlike what UC specifies. | "If the system detects a malfunction or fails to operate within expected parameters (e.g., sensor failure or improper lighting adjustment), it will notify the user with an alert and suggest corrective actions." |
| UC expects full energy efficiency, but SSTS does not fully address energy usage in all weather conditions, such as fog or rain. | "The system provides enhanced visibility through automatic beam adjustments to illuminate the road, signs, and obstacles effectively." |
