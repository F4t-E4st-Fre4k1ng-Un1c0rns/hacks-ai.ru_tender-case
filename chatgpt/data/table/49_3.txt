| The SSTS does not mention integration with the vehicle's security system for triggering alarms or immobilizing the vehicle in case of theft, as required in the UC. | "The system integrates with the vehicle’s onboard security system to trigger alarms or immobilize the vehicle in case of theft detection." |
| The SSTS does not specify the frequency of real-time location updates, leaving uncertainty in continuous tracking. The UC expects continuous updates. | "The system provides the user with real-time GPS location updates, visible on a map via the monitoring app." |
| The SSTS does not include a defined response or handling process for geofence breaches, while the UC expects immediate alerts when such events occur. | "If the vehicle moves outside the defined geofence, the system sends a real-time alert with details about the event." |
| The SSTS does not mention the exact priority or hierarchy of alerts, particularly distinguishing theft alerts from geofence violations, as expected in the UC. | "Upon detecting unauthorized movement or theft, the system sends an immediate alert to the user via mobile notification." |
| The SSTS does not include an explicit fallback mechanism or more detailed handling in case of GPS or connectivity issues, which the UC requires. | "In case of connectivity or hardware issues, the system will notify the user and display a warning message while halting tracking until the issue is resolved." |
| The SSTS does not clarify how location history is accessed in detail, which is specified in the UC. | "The sub-system logs all vehicle locations, storing the data securely and allowing the user to review the history via the app interface." |
