| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not explicitly confirm that the ambient lighting system will be fully functional if other vehicle systems are experiencing issues, as required by UC. | "The system requires the central control interface to be functional, but there is no specific mention that the ambient lighting control is guaranteed to be operational if other vehicle systems (e.g., navigation, infotainment) are experiencing issues." |
| SSTS mentions voice control, but does not guarantee its consistent availability or functionality, whereas UC expects this feature to be fully operational. | "The user provides a voice command that includes the words 'adjust lighting' or other similar keywords that activate the system." |
| SSTS lacks clarity on whether visual confirmation will always be provided immediately after a change, particularly if there's a delay due to system processing, which is expected by UC. | "The interior lighting updates immediately to reflect the new settings. A visual update of the lighting will be displayed across all zones as per the user’s preferences." |
| SSTS does not address what happens if the user exits the system prematurely, or if the system resets unexpectedly, while UC specifies that the settings should be retained after exiting. | "If the user exits the lighting control interface or switches to another vehicle function, the lighting settings remain as adjusted until further changes are made." |
| SSTS does not fully describe how the system recovers from errors, which the UC specifies should happen seamlessly. | "In the event of a system error (e.g., malfunction or unresponsiveness), an error message will be displayed, and the system will revert to default settings if the issue is not resolved." |
