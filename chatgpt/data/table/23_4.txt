|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The SSTS does not fully specify the handling of notifications (messages, likes, comments) as required by the UC. | "Notifications for new interactions (comments, likes, messages) will be displayed, allowing the user to respond to them in real-time via voice commands or touch interface." |
| The UC requires voice-to-text functionality for posting and commenting, but the SSTS lacks clarity on real-time voice-to-text conversion. | "The system will allow text input, voice-to-text functionality for comments or messages, and media uploads from the vehicle’s interface." |
| The SSTS does not clearly address the management of active social media sessions, especially ensuring secure log-off, which is specified in the UC. | "The system will automatically terminate any social media session if the internet connection is lost or becomes unavailable, displaying a message indicating the connection issue and allowing the user to retry or return to the main menu." |
| The UC specifies that the system should allow seamless access and interaction with multiple platforms, but the SSTS only mentions Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, without elaborating on handling multiple platforms simultaneously. | "The system must be compatible with at least the following platforms: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter." |
| The UC specifies that social media access should be non-distracting and fully integrated with the infotainment system, but the SSTS does not explicitly guarantee a non-distracting interface. | "The system ensures a non-distracting interface to provide a seamless integration with the vehicle’s infotainment environment." (This is implied but not fully detailed in the SSTS.) |
| The SSTS does not address the fallback mechanisms for when users are unable to log in due to authentication errors or other failures, which is covered in the UC. | "User logs in to their social media account through the infotainment system, allowing the system to retrieve the user’s feed and notifications." (No mention of handling failed logins or authentication errors.) |
