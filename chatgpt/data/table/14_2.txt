|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not clearly define the integration of "driving modes" within user profiles, while UC expects full profile-based customization, including driving modes. | "Profiles can be automatically applied based on user identification through methods like key fobs, mobile apps, or biometric recognition." |
| SSTS does not mention the ability for users to delete or permanently modify profiles, whereas UC requires full user control over profile creation, modification, and deletion. | "A new user profile is created or an existing profile is modified through the vehicle interface or mobile app." |
| SSTS does not ensure automatic profile loading, leaving it up to user selection, while UC expects the system to automatically apply profiles when a user is detected. | "A user manually selects a profile via the central vehicle interface or mobile app." |
| SSTS lacks clear specifications on the real-time application of all settings when profiles are switched, as required in the UC. | "The vehicle applies the settings associated with the identified user profile, adjusting parameters such as seat position, climate control, media preferences, and driving modes in real time." |
| SSTS does not fully define the behavior of the system when no user is present or when the user logs out, while UC expects automatic resetting of settings to default or unassigned. | "The system logs out the user after a period of inactivity and resets the profile to default or unassigned settings." |
