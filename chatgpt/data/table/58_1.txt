| The UC specifies the need for the system to provide real-time notifications for road hazards and traffic conditions. The SSTS mentions hazard detection but lacks details on real-time notifications for conditions like congestion or road closures. | "Notifications regarding road conditions, such as accidents or construction zones, are sent to the driver to adjust the route or speed accordingly." |
| The UC outlines that the system should optimize routes based on available traffic data, including both real-time traffic conditions and alternate routes. The SSTS only mentions hazard notifications without detailing route optimization in the presence of traffic data. | "Notifications regarding road conditions, such as accidents or construction zones, are sent to the driver to adjust the route or speed accordingly." |
| The UC requires the V2I system to communicate with infrastructure continuously, but the SSTS only activates the system upon entering a V2I zone, potentially leaving a gap in communication when moving between zones. | "The vehicle enters an area covered by V2I-enabled infrastructure, such as an intersection with smart traffic signals or a nearby charging station." |
| The UC specifies that the system should be able to handle multiple communication scenarios, including failure or downtime, while the SSTS only mentions loss of communication in general terms without describing specific failure handling procedures. | "Communication with the infrastructure stops in case of a signal loss, system failure, or when the vehicle is no longer in the vicinity of V2I-enabled infrastructure." |
| The UC mentions that the system should log and store all V2I interactions for future diagnostics, whereas the SSTS only refers to logging interactions without emphasizing diagnostics or future improvements. | "All V2I interactions are logged for diagnostic and future system optimization purposes." |
| The UC specifies the need for integration with navigation systems to enhance route planning, but the SSTS does not mention any direct integration with navigation systems for real-time adjustments. | "The system displays relevant updates and alerts on the vehicle’s infotainment or dashboard." |
