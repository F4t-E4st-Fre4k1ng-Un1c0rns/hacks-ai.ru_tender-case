|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The UC explicitly mentions a requirement for continuous scanning, while the SSTS mentions scanning without specifying continuity. | "The system will continuously check for the presence of a valid driver to authenticate access." |
| The UC suggests the inclusion of detailed sensor requirements (proximity sensors or RFID), but the SSTS only mentions general sensor or proximity detection without specification. | "The vehicle must have sensors or proximity detectors to detect the driver’s presence and initiate the identification process." |
| The UC implies that manual unlocking methods (e.g., key entry) should be available in case of system failure, but the SSTS mentions only contacting support without specifying manual unlocking methods. | "In the event of repeated identification failure, the system will enter a fail-safe mode and deny further access until the issue is addressed (such as manual unlocking or system support)." |
| The SSTS does not clearly specify a power source requirement, which is mentioned in the UC. | "A reliable power source must be available for the system to function continuously during vehicle operation." |
| The SSTS does not explicitly mention alternative identification methods (such as PIN entry) during failure events, though it does hint at them. | "If identification fails, the system will prompt the driver to attempt an alternative identification method, such as entering a PIN or re-scanning biometric data." |
