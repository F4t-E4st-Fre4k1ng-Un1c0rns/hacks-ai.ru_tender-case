| UC specifies that the system must adjust responses for both basic commands (e.g., navigation, climate) and non-functional tasks, but SSTS does not explicitly mention non-functional commands like vehicle diagnostics or settings. | "The voice assistant will respond according to the user’s selected style for commands related to navigation, entertainment, and other vehicle functions." |
| UC mentions that the customization should reflect a high degree of personalization (including responses for vehicle diagnostics), while SSTS limits the response types to a subset of vehicle commands. | "The system applies the user-defined preferences to the voice assistant’s responses... for commands related to navigation, entertainment, and other vehicle functions." |
| UC indicates that customization should be persistent and automatically applied to future sessions without reconfiguration by the user, but SSTS does not specify the persistence of settings across all system reboots or after major software updates. | "The system will apply the requested voice customization settings... once customized, these settings are applied to all voice interactions, including commands related to navigation, entertainment, climate control, and other in-car functionalities." |
| UC implies that customization can be easily reverted or modified at any time, but SSTS does not mention the ease of resetting or modifying these preferences once they are set. | "The system confirms the successful application of the customization changes and retains these settings until the user decides to modify them again." |
| UC requires the vehicle's voice assistant to provide different levels of personalization (e.g., response complexity or emotional tone), but SSTS only mentions basic customizations like tone and language. | "Users can adjust settings for the voice assistant's tone, language, formality, and style of responses." |
