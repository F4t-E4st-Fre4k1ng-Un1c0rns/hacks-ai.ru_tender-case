| The underpinning contract expects a highly personalized recommendation system with detailed real-time adjustments based on user mood and driving context, while the SSTS lacks specific mention of mood-based personalization. | "The system delivers personalized entertainment recommendations, including music, playlists, or podcasts, based on the analysis of user preferences and driving context." |
| The UC specifies the system should adapt recommendations dynamically based on real-time user feedback (e.g., skipping songs, mood detection), while the SSTS does not mention real-time mood detection or feedback adaptation. | "Recommendations are presented either via voice prompts or through the infotainment screen, based on user settings." |
| UC requires a more robust and seamless integration with third-party services, but SSTS does not guarantee full, uninterrupted access to external platforms (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music) in all conditions. | "The system requires access to third-party streaming services (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music) for content recommendations." |
| The UC assumes continuous internet availability for fetching recommendations, but the SSTS allows for degraded functionality and offline modes when connectivity is unavailable. | "In case of an internet connectivity issue, the system will suggest available offline content or switch to alternative entertainment modes, such as radio or Bluetooth." |
| UC suggests voice interaction should be fully context-aware, while SSTS only mentions basic voice control, lacking deeper contextual understanding for indirect requests. | "The voice recognition system must be operational to allow hands-free interaction with the system." |
| The UC specifies that the system should continuously refine recommendations based on real-time user interaction, but SSTS mentions this only as part of specific actions like skipping tracks or requesting a new recommendation. | "Content is played with volume adjustments according to user preferences and current driving conditions (e.g., increased volume for highway driving)." |
