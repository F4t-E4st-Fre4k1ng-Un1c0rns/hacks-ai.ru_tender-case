|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not fully specify the requirement for integration with all telematics systems for detailed vehicle performance monitoring (e.g., tire pressure, energy consumption). | "The sub-system must be integrated with the telematics systems of all vehicles within the fleet to ensure real-time data transfer." |
| The SSTS lacks detailed descriptions of real-time, fleet-wide alerts for performance optimization, which is required by the UC. | "Alerts are sent when the system identifies abnormal behavior or requires immediate attention (e.g., a vehicle's battery is underperforming or maintenance is overdue)." |
| The SSTS does not fully comply with the UC's requirement for predictive maintenance being automatically triggered for all performance issues. | "Predictive maintenance algorithms are triggered automatically when the system detects potential vehicle performance issues based on usage patterns and sensor data." |
| The SSTS does not include an explicit mention of proactive fleet-wide performance analytics and efficiency insights, which are outlined in the UC. | "The system provides real-time visual analytics, including charts, graphs, and tables that display vehicle health, energy consumption patterns, and performance metrics for individual vehicles and the entire fleet." |
| The SSTS lacks details on the system's ability to generate long-term, trend-based reports as required for long-term fleet optimization in the UC. | "The system generates historical data reports that help identify long-term trends in fleet performance, supporting decision-making for future fleet management and vehicle replacements." |
| SSTS does not mention the necessary data retention or session saving mechanisms for audit trails, which is a requirement in the UC. | "Data is automatically logged and stored in a secure database, ensuring full audit trails and accessibility for further analysis and reporting." |
