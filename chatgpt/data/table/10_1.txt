| UC implies the system should always offer real-time traffic adjustments, but the SSTS mentions that the system can revert to historical data if connectivity is lost. | "If real-time traffic updates are unavailable due to connectivity issues or lack of data, the system will revert to a default route based on historical traffic data." |
| UC expects seamless route recalculation based on live traffic data at all times, while the SSTS allows for interruptions and manual input under certain conditions. | "The system stops functioning if the user manually disables or stops using the navigation system." |
| UC expects the system to continuously update and optimize routes without failure, but the SSTS specifies that in case of no data, the system uses default or historical routing. | "The system will revert to a default route based on historical traffic data." |
| UC suggests that traffic updates should always be available, while the SSTS notes that the system may fail to provide real-time updates if there is a loss of connectivity. | "The system is triggered when the user inputs a destination into the navigation system... the system will provide only basic route guidance using the last available traffic data or default historical routing." |
| UC does not address the possibility of system failures or manual adjustments, but the SSTS outlines conditions where the system may stop or revert to default data. | "The system stops functioning if the vehicle loses connectivity to the internet or GPS." |
