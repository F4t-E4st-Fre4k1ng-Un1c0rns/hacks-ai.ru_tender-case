| UC specifies the system should allow full control of all vehicle features, including seat adjustments and lighting, which are not mentioned in the SSTS. | "The specification covers features such as locking/unlocking doors, engine start/stop, climate control, location tracking, and window control." |
| UC requires a defined failover mechanism (e.g., SMS or alternative method when internet fails), but SSTS does not mention any such backup option. | "A stable and secure internet connection (mobile data or Wi-Fi) is required for communication between the mobile app and the vehicle." |
| UC specifies real-time status updates during feature execution, but SSTS does not clarify intermediate feedback during longer actions or in case of partial success. | "Upon receiving a command, the vehicle will execute the action and communicate the result back to the mobile app." |
| UC mentions a comprehensive error handling process, including specific failure scenarios, which the SSTS lacks. | "If the action cannot be completed due to system failure, poor connectivity, or other issues (e.g., battery depletion, server error), the app will display an error message." |
| UC requires the vehicle's battery to be specifically operational for remote actions, whereas SSTS only generically states that the battery needs to be sufficiently charged but lacks clear functional requirements. | "The vehicle's battery must be sufficiently charged to allow for the remote operation of key features (e.g., starting the engine, locking/unlocking doors, etc.)." |
