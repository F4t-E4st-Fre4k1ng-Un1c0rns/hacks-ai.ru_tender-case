|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not explicitly mention "voltage" as a core monitoring feature, while the UC includes voltage as part of battery monitoring. | "The system provides real-time updates on the EV’s battery health, including SOC, voltage, temperature, and charging rate, displayed on the user interface." |
| SSTS does not mention adherence to specific industry or manufacturer standards for operational conditions of the battery system. | "The EV battery system should be fully operational and capable of delivering accurate data, including metrics such as SOC, temperature, and voltage." |
| SSTS lacks specification for user-defined thresholds for charge level, whereas the UC mentions user customization for notifications related to battery charge level. | "The system monitors battery parameters continuously and triggers an alert if predefined thresholds (e.g., SOC below 20%, battery temperature exceeds safety limits) are breached." |
| SSTS does not explicitly address long-term battery health trends storage, which is mentioned in the UC. | "Historical data of battery performance is stored, accessible by the user for reviewing trends and making long-term maintenance decisions." |
| SSTS does not mention handling mobile session expiry or interruptions, whereas the UC describes exit conditions when a session is interrupted or expired. | "The sub-system terminates the remote monitoring session when the user logs out of the mobile application or web platform." |
