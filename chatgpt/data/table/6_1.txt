| UC mentions personalized features based on user driving history, but SSTS does not fully elaborate on the depth of personalization. | "The system leverages personalized features based on the user's preferences and historical data, ensuring an optimized and smooth navigation experience." |
| UC specifies a requirement for the system to fully integrate the user’s driving history for personalized routes, which is not clearly outlined in the SSTS. | "The system provides personalized features, such as saved locations or recent destinations, to optimize the navigation experience." |
| UC requires a more comprehensive troubleshooting guide in case of system failure, while SSTS only mentions basic steps for failure recovery. | "The system suggests troubleshooting in case of failure but may not be as thorough or accessible in some cases." |
| UC specifies that voice command features should always be accessible and responsive; SSTS implies that certain scenarios (e.g., connectivity issues) might prevent this. | "If the system is unable to complete the navigation (e.g., due to a loss of GPS signal or lack of data), it provides a message like 'Navigation interrupted. Please try again later.'" |
| UC requires the system to adapt based on real-time user preferences like traffic habits; SSTS mentions preferences but not full adaptation. | "The system updates the route dynamically, providing continuous, real-time directions and offering step-by-step guidance." |
| UC expects the system to ensure a seamless and immediate response to voice commands in all situations, but SSTS does not guarantee this. | "The system does support voice commands and rerouting, but depending on the vehicle's environment (e.g., rural areas or low-traffic zones), real-time route updates and charging station availability might not always be as seamless or immediate as described in the contract." |
