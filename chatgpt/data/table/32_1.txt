| SSTS does not clearly specify the impact of adverse weather conditions (e.g., fog, heavy rain) on sensor performance. The UC requires clear operational limits in such conditions. | "The system is intended for use in normal driving conditions, and its performance may degrade in adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, or snow." |
| SSTS lacks a detailed protocol for handling intermittent sensor failures, unlike the UC, which expects clear actions for partial sensor failures. | "The system will remain inactive until repaired or recalibrated." |
| The UC specifies a 1.5-second window for driver inaction, which is reflected in SSTS, but the SSTS doesn't provide a clear threshold for the relative speed or distance in the "imminent collision" trigger condition. | "The system will activate if the vehicle’s speed is such that an impact is likely to occur within a short period, and the driver has not taken corrective action (such as braking or steering) within a set time frame (e.g., 1.5 seconds)." |
| The UC mentions that AEBAS should work at speeds above 5 km/h, but SSTS does not specify the minimum speed for trigger conditions directly in the context of vehicle behavior. | "The vehicle must be in motion, with a speed above 5 km/h for the AEBAS to be active." |
| SSTS doesn't clarify the exact 2-meter threshold for collision detection, while the UC clearly states a 2-meter distance as a criterion for triggering the system. | "The system will activate if the vehicle is within a set threshold of distance (e.g., 2 meters) from the detected object and the relative speed is high." |
