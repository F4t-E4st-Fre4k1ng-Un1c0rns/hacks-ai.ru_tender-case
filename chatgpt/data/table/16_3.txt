| SSTS limits voice command functionality to basic climate control, whereas UC implies a more flexible and seamless multi-command support. | "The system can recognize a limited set of basic voice commands; however, some advanced or customized commands (e.g., multi-step adjustments) may not be fully supported or require additional configuration." |
| SSTS mentions microphone performance issues in noisy environments, but UC assumes reliable voice recognition under all conditions. | "The microphone must be functional, capable of detecting voice inputs in typical vehicle environments, but may struggle in noisy conditions or with ambient sound interference." |
| SSTS specifies failure to execute multi-step commands, while UC assumes these commands should be processed seamlessly. | "Complex or multi-step commands (e.g., 'Set the temperature to 22°C and turn on the seat heaters') may not be fully executed, and the user will be instructed to issue simpler, individual commands." |
| SSTS lacks support for full voice command recognition in all conditions, whereas UC anticipates smooth, uninterrupted voice control. | "If the system is unable to understand the command, it will prompt the user with an error message (e.g., 'Command not recognized. Please try again.')." |
| SSTS allows for manual override in cases of voice command failure, while UC assumes the system should function without manual intervention. | "If there is a microphone issue or a failure in the voice assistant, the user will be prompted to use manual controls to adjust the climate settings." |
| SSTS states the system may exit after an error or multiple failed attempts, while UC expects a more seamless user experience. | "The system may automatically exit if the vehicle's microphone system stops functioning or if the system detects prolonged inactivity." |
