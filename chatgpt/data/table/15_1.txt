|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not mention the drive control system as part of OTA updates, although UC specifies that OTA updates must cover all system components, including drive control. | "The Over-the-Air Software Updates system provides remote software updates to in-vehicle systems, including infotainment, navigation, and driving assistance." |
| UC requires that both Wi-Fi and cellular network connections be available for update functionality, while SSTS prioritizes Wi-Fi and lists cellular as secondary. | "The vehicle must be connected to a stable Wi-Fi or cellular network." |
| UC mandates that users must have a registered account and provide consent to receive OTA updates; SSTS does not mention this user registration and consent requirement. | *No mention of user account registration and consent in SSTS.* |
| The UC specifies that the user must receive notifications at both the start and completion of the update, while SSTS only confirms an initial notification and final confirmation. | "Notifications are displayed to inform the user of the update start, completion, and any restart requirements." |
| UC explicitly requires all security patches and optimizations to be operational post-update; SSTS only broadly mentions feature enhancements, lacking specific assurance of security patches and optimizations. | "All in-vehicle systems operate on the updated software version, with optimizations, feature enhancements, and security patches fully integrated." |
