| The underpinning contract specifies more detailed personalization (e.g., climate control settings), but the SSTS only mentions seat and mirror adjustments. | "Upon successful authentication, the system will unlock the vehicle and apply the driver’s personalized settings, such as seat position, mirror adjustments, and infotainment preferences." |
| The UC requires the system to offer alternative authentication methods (e.g., PIN or backup RFID), but the SSTS does not describe these options. | "If authentication is unsuccessful, the system will deny access to the vehicle and display an error message." |
| The underpinning contract specifies that logging should include all access attempts (successful and failed), but the SSTS only mentions failed attempts in the execution output. | "The system will log the failed authentication attempt, including the timestamp and reason for failure (e.g., unrecognized credentials)." |
| The UC mentions that the system should apply full personalized settings upon recognition, including infotainment preferences, but the SSTS does not detail infotainment personalization. | "Upon successful authentication, the system will unlock the vehicle and apply the driver’s personalized settings, such as seat position, mirror adjustments, and infotainment preferences." |
| The UC mentions "locked" and "ready" vehicle states, while the SSTS uses "sleep" mode, which is not directly aligned with the UC's specific terminology. | "The vehicle’s system must be powered on and in a state ready for authentication (not in 'sleep' or 'locked' mode)." |
