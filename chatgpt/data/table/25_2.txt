| The UC mentions dynamic transitions based on both time of day and external light intensity, but the SSTS only refers to external light conditions and does not clearly address time-based transitions. | "The system triggers day mode when external light conditions exceed a predefined threshold, indicating daylight." |
| The UC requires a clear handling of dusk conditions in the transition from day to night mode, while the SSTS lacks specific mention of "dusk" as a transition phase. | "The system triggers night mode when external light levels drop below a predefined threshold, indicating dusk or nighttime." |
| The UC requires the system to adjust based on road type (e.g., highways vs. city streets) more explicitly, but the SSTS lacks detailed handling of road types in terms of lighting adjustment. | "The system detects road type through GPS and adjusts headlight range, intensity, and direction (e.g., broader lighting for highways, focused lighting for city streets)." |
| The UC specifies glare reduction features as part of the system's functionality, while the SSTS does not explicitly mention a mechanism for glare reduction. | "The system adjusts lighting based on vehicle speed, ensuring optimal illumination for low-speed and high-speed driving conditions." |
| The UC implies that the system should operate seamlessly, even in case of failure, with minimal user intervention, whereas the SSTS suggests a manual override or a default setting in case of malfunction. | "The system enters error state if GPS or speed sensors fail, requiring a reset or technical support intervention for full functionality restoration." |
