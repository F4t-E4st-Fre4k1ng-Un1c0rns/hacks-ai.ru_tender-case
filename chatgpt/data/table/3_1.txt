| The UC explicitly mentions that the system should allow switching between "eco, standard, and sport modes," while the SSTS only refers to "driving modes" without specifying these options. | "The system provides options to switch between eco, standard, and sport driving modes to cater to the user’s driving preferences." |
| UC mentions the system should function with multiple user profiles, while the SSTS does not clarify multi-user functionality and only refers to "user profiles" in a generic sense. | "The vehicle should support user profiles, allowing for saving of customized settings." |
| UC suggests that customization settings should be temporarily adjusted for a single session, but the SSTS does not specify this temporary option, implying settings are either saved or reset. | "The settings will be saved to the user’s profile or reset to default based on the user’s choice." |
| UC describes the system's interaction with traffic conditions as directly influencing customization settings, while the SSTS does not specify how traffic data affects customization settings beyond basic triggers. | "The system detects the vehicle's speed and surrounding traffic conditions, automatically adjusting sensitivity and response settings." |
| UC specifies that users can adjust acceleration and deceleration separately, while the SSTS combines them into one response level. | "Customize the vehicle's acceleration and deceleration levels for smoother transitions in different traffic conditions." |
