| The UC specifies that the system must always be compatible with toll and parking infrastructures, whereas the SSTS lacks clear validation procedures for this compatibility. | "The toll and parking facilities must support integration with the In-Car Payment System to enable seamless transactions. Compatibility checks should be performed to ensure the system's operational effectiveness with local infrastructure." |
| UC requires that the vehicle software be up-to-date to ensure full functionality, but the SSTS does not specify a method for ensuring this (e.g., automatic updates or checks). | "The vehicle's software must be up-to-date to ensure compatibility with the latest version of the In-Car Payment System Integration. Regular software updates must be installed automatically or manually by the user." |
| UC mandates user authentication through login or biometric verification, but the SSTS only mentions "secure login" without specifying biometric authentication. | "The user must register at least one valid payment method (credit card, debit card, or digital wallet) in the system settings. The system will periodically validate the payment method to ensure it is active and valid." |
| UC states that users should always receive a transaction receipt after payment, while the SSTS makes receipt generation optional. | "A digital receipt is generated and stored within the vehicle’s history log. The user is given the option to receive the receipt via email or download it for future reference." |
| UC specifies that error logs should be created for maintenance purposes in case of failure, whereas the SSTS only mentions a system reset without reference to error logging. | "Upon transaction completion, whether successful or unsuccessful, the system logs the payment history and resets to the ready state for the next transaction attempt." |
