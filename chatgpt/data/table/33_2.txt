|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not fully address the need for integration with third-party authentication methods, as required by the UC. | *"The sub-System offers multiple authentication methods, including biometrics (fingerprint and facial recognition), digital keys, and PIN codes."* |
| UC requires always-on connectivity for real-time verification, but SSTS only mentions cloud-based or local server verification, without specifying real-time operational requirements. | *"The authentication system must be operational and either locally hosted on the vehicle or connected to a cloud-based server for real-time verification."* |
| UC specifies the need for detailed failure messages, but SSTS does not explicitly mention providing detailed failure information. | *"If authentication fails, the system provides an error message indicating the failure reason (e.g., incorrect fingerprint, connectivity issue), and prompts the user to retry or select an alternative authentication method."* |
| UC requires a fallback mechanism for failed authentication attempts, such as manual access options, which SSTS does not adequately define. | *"If multiple failed attempts occur, the system may temporarily lock the user out or offer manual intervention options, such as contacting support or using a backup access method."* |
| SSTS does not clarify if the user can easily retry authentication or contact support after failure, as required by the UC. | *"The system denies access and exits with an error message or log for further analysis."* |
| UC requires a seamless, hands-free authentication experience (proximity detection), but SSTS only mentions manual or app-triggered access methods. | *"The user manually activates the app or the vehicle's interface to initiate access."* |
