| SSTS mentions that app functionality may be limited or inconsistent, which is not specified in the UC. | "The system supports a variety of apps, but there are instances of limited functionality, connectivity issues, or delays in performance due to API or network limitations." |
| SSTS specifies that some app features may not work seamlessly, but the UC requires full seamless integration. | "While the system supports a variety of apps, there are instances of limited functionality, connectivity issues, or delays in performance." |
| SSTS does not guarantee stable internet connectivity, contrary to the UC's implied expectation of reliable connection. | "The car has internet connectivity, either through the vehicle’s own network or through a mobile hotspot." |
| The UC expects apps to function with full user interaction (touch, voice commands, and steering wheel controls), while SSTS suggests that voice and touch controls may be delayed or unresponsive. | "Voice commands or touch controls may not always be responsive, and users may experience delays or errors in their interactions with the app." |
| The UC specifies that third-party app integration should be completely functional after successful interaction, while the SSTS acknowledges potential app failures. | "The app may be partially functional or experience delays, especially with location-based apps like navigation." |
| SSTS allows for app exits due to network or connectivity failure, whereas the UC assumes smooth transition or functionality. | "The system will automatically exit or close the app if a critical error or connectivity failure occurs, and the user is returned to the main menu or another app interface." |
