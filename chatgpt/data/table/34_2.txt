| UC emphasizes the importance of real-time data updates (e.g., music track info, navigation) but the SSTS does not stress this aspect of data synchronization as heavily. | "Real-time data from the app is shown, such as song information, navigation route updates, or message alerts." |
| UC specifies the requirement for system compatibility with specific third-party platforms like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, while the SSTS only mentions general compatibility. | "The vehicle’s infotainment system must support third-party app integration through platforms like Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, or proprietary solutions." |
| UC highlights user interaction via touchscreen and voice commands but does not explicitly mention internet connectivity as a trigger, whereas the SSTS does. | "The infotainment system detects an available internet connection and establishes synchronization with the third-party apps on the user’s mobile device." |
| UC details how the system should maintain connection and notify the user if the app becomes available again after a failure, which is not fully reflected in the SSTS. | "The user is notified of the issue" and "The system responds with appropriate visual and audio feedback based on user interactions with the app." |
| UC specifies that the app should be accessible even after intermittent disconnections or failures, but SSTS lacks emphasis on automatic reconnection or restoring the app seamlessly. | "The user manually disables third-party app integration or disconnects the mobile device, terminating the app session." |
