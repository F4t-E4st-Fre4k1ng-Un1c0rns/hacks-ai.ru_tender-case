| SSTS specifies that distraction detection is triggered only after the vehicle exceeds 5 km/h, whereas UC requires immediate activation once the vehicle starts moving. | "The system is triggered when the vehicle exceeds 5 km/h, or once the vehicle is moving after the engine is started." |
| SSTS does not explicitly mention seat vibration alerts as required by the UC. | "The system triggers a combination of visual, audible, and haptic alerts. This includes: A visual warning on the dashboard with a flashing symbol and a text notification ('Driver Attention Required'). A series of audible warnings (e.g., a repeating chime) to capture the driver's attention." |
| SSTS includes a 10-second delay before escalating an alert if no action is taken, whereas UC requires immediate escalation. | "The system will trigger an escalation if no action is taken by the driver within 10 seconds after an initial distraction warning." |
| SSTS allows for distraction detection if only a single facial feature (either eyes or face) is visible, but UC requires full facial monitoring for more accurate detection. | "The driver’s seat must be occupied, and the driver must be within the detection range of the system’s cameras for accurate facial recognition." |
| SSTS specifies that the system deactivates when the vehicle is stationary, whereas UC specifies it should deactivate only when the engine is turned off. | "The system will automatically deactivate when the vehicle comes to a complete stop (e.g., at a traffic light or parking) or when the engine is turned off." |
| SSTS does not emphasize the immediate alert to the driver in case of a system malfunction, as required by UC. | "If the camera system or sensors malfunction, the system will immediately deactivate distraction monitoring, issue a failure notification to the driver, and log the error." |
