| UC requires the system to automatically sync preferences and data when the user enters the vehicle, but SSTS does not explicitly mention automatic synchronization on entry. | "The system is triggered when the user enters the vehicle, and the ignition is turned on, initiating the connection to the cloud service." |
| UC specifies that the vehicle should provide a seamless experience with cloud access for personal data and music, but SSTS does not emphasize the "seamless" nature of access. | "The system retrieves the user’s music library, preferences, and other personal data from the cloud and synchronizes them with the vehicle’s infotainment system." |
| UC requires clear error handling and fallback functionality for cloud service failures, but SSTS doesn't clarify the exact error recovery process for connectivity issues. | "If the system fails to establish a connection to the cloud, it enters a fallback mode, offering offline functionality or prompting the user to check their internet connection." |
| UC requires data to be available at all times, even when the cloud is unavailable, but SSTS only mentions offline functionality in case of connectivity loss, without a mention of continuous availability of data in all scenarios. | "In case of connectivity loss, the system switches to offline mode, allowing the user to access stored music and preferences without cloud interaction." |
| UC specifies the vehicle should sync music libraries and user data from the cloud seamlessly, while SSTS does not explicitly mention the synchronization of music libraries or the specific types of user data like settings. | "The system retrieves the user’s music library, preferences, and other personal data from the cloud and synchronizes them with the vehicle’s infotainment system." |
| UC mandates that the system must notify the user if synchronization fails, but SSTS does not mention any specific notifications or alerts for failed sync attempts. | *No relevant quotation found in SSTS regarding user notifications for synchronization failure.* |
