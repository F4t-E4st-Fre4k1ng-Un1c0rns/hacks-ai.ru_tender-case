|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not explicitly define facial and eye movement calibration as an ongoing process, as required by the UC. | "The system must complete an initial calibration process to identify the driver’s facial features and set baseline data for distraction detection." |
| SSTS mentions corrective actions such as lane-keeping and speed adjustments but does not clearly define a severity-based or tiered response, as outlined in the UC. | "If the driver does not respond to the initial alert within 5 seconds, the system may take corrective actions, such as: Activating lane-keeping assistance...Adjusting the vehicle speed..." |
| SSTS provides a general notification for sensor malfunctions, but the UC requires more detailed notifications regarding temporary system unavailability. | "The system will trigger a fault notification if any sensors (e.g., camera or infrared sensors) are obstructed, malfunctioning, or unable to detect necessary data..." |
| SSTS lacks specific mention of haptic feedback as a distinct corrective action, although the UC specifies its inclusion. | "Upon detecting a distraction or drowsiness, the system will trigger an audible warning sound, display a visual alert on the dashboard, and initiate haptic feedback (e.g., vibration in the steering wheel)." |
| SSTS does not specify how driver response is measured or expected (e.g., stopping the car), while the UC indicates that the system should expect some form of driver action to respond to alerts. | "If the driver does not respond to the initial alert within 5 seconds, the system may take corrective actions..." |
| SSTS mentions data logging but does not define a review process for the logs, as required by the UC for diagnostic review by the driver or service personnel. | "All alerts, corrective actions, and detected malfunctions will be logged in the vehicle’s onboard memory, accessible for later review by the driver or service personnel." |
| SSTS describes system disengagement via manual settings but does not detail how it communicates to the driver that the system is disengaged, as required by the UC. | "The system can be manually disengaged by the driver through the vehicle’s settings or infotainment menu." |
| SSTS lacks detailed procedures for resolving issues caused by sensor failure (e.g., clearing obstructions), while the UC emphasizes notification and reactivation of the system when malfunctions are fixed. | "If the system detects that a malfunctioning sensor has been restored to working condition (e.g., camera lens cleaned, lighting corrected), the system will notify the driver and resume normal operation." |
