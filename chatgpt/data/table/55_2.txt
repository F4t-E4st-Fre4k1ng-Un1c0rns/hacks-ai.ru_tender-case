| SSTS does not specify the requirement that the driver must be seated with the seatbelt fastened for the system to function. | "The system operates only when the car is in 'Drive' mode and the driver’s seatbelt is fastened." |
| SSTS does not explicitly mention that the system should provide manual mirror check prompts when it fails, which is required in the UC. | "If the system detects a malfunction or environmental issue, a warning will be displayed on the instrument cluster and central display, advising the driver to manually check the mirrors." |
| SSTS makes haptic feedback optional, while the UC suggests it should be an active feature during lane changes when a vehicle is in the blind spot. | "Haptic Feedback: If the system detects a potential lane change or turn while a vehicle is in the blind spot, it may provide brief haptic feedback through the steering wheel to alert the driver and discourage the maneuver." |
| SSTS does not specify that the system will alert the driver to manually check mirrors if the sensors cannot reliably detect objects, as required in the UC. | "The system will exit if the environmental conditions (e.g., heavy rain, fog, or snow) cause the sensors to lose accuracy or fail to detect objects reliably." |
| SSTS only mentions the visual and auditory alerts for lane changes, without addressing the specifics of the warning during lane change attempts, as indicated in the UC. | "An audible warning (tone or chime) will sound when a vehicle is detected in the blind spot and the driver initiates a lane change or turns on the turn signal." |
| SSTS does not mention the activation of the system when the driver activates the turn signal, which is detailed in the UC. | "The driver engages the turn signal or initiates a lane change, and a vehicle is detected in the blind spot." |
