| SSTS mentions that the system may have limitations due to incomplete or delayed traffic data, while UC expects real-time accurate data for rerouting. | "The system may face limitations due to occasional delays in data updates, incomplete traffic data, or network connectivity issues." |
| UC requires fully automated re-routing without manual intervention, whereas SSTS specifies that the system sometimes requires manual input from the user. | "User manual request to reroute after noticing delays or traffic issues." |
| SSTS allows the system to revert to the original route if traffic data is insufficient, but UC expects continuous real-time rerouting regardless of data availability. | "If traffic data is unavailable, the system will continue using the initial route based on historical data without live adjustments." |
| UC requires the system to detect and respond to all traffic conditions in real-time, but SSTS notes that traffic events may not always be detected due to incomplete or poor data. | "The system may not detect all relevant traffic events such as smaller accidents or congestion in real-time, especially in areas with limited traffic monitoring infrastructure." |
| UC outlines that the system should automatically adjust routes based on traffic, but SSTS allows for failure or delays in automatic re-routing, leading to potential suboptimal routes. | "The system may fail to trigger re-routing or may not provide alternative routes if the traffic data is incomplete." |
