| The underpinning contract does not specify HD video quality, while the SSTS explicitly mentions it. | "The system must be capable of supporting HD video resolution (1080p or higher) for optimal playback quality." |
| The contract mentions user control via voice commands and touchscreen, but the SSTS places a stronger emphasis on these features and details their functionality. | "The user can interact with the system using either touchscreen controls or voice commands to control video playback, adjust volume, or skip scenes." |
| The underpinning contract doesn't mention real-time buffering or error messages during interruptions, while the SSTS specifies this functionality. | "The system streams video content in HD quality (1080p or higher) without interruptions, provided there is a stable internet connection. If the internet connection is interrupted, the system will display an error message indicating the issue and suggest troubleshooting steps." |
| The contract does not discuss the troubleshooting process or system responses to errors in detail, whereas the SSTS includes error-handling steps and recovery options. | "In the event of a system error, such as loss of internet connection or subscription issues, the system will display error messages and automatically return to the video selection screen or main menu after the issue is acknowledged." |
| The underpinning contract states that users should be able to exit the service by returning to the home menu or stopping playback, but the SSTS adds more details on system recovery after an issue. | "The user exits the video streaming interface by either selecting a different app or returning to the main menu of the infotainment system. If the user logs out of their account or disconnects from the internet, the system will exit the video streaming mode and prompt the user to reconnect or log back in." |
