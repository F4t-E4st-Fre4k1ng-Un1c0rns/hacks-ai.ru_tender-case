| UC specifies full customization of all settings like seat, temperature, lighting, and audio, while SSTS omits certain advanced settings like seat temperature control. | "The system adjusts the relevant vehicle setting (e.g., adjusts seat position, modifies cabin temperature, changes lighting, or adjusts audio)." |
| UC requires the system to handle complex multi-command inputs, but SSTS lacks support for handling overlapping or compound commands effectively. | "The system remains active and responsive until the user completes a command, cancels the interaction, or the system is manually deactivated." |
| UC expects system feedback to be specific and timely, but SSTS only offers generic error responses, which could lead to ambiguity. | "If an error persists, the system prompts the user to either use manual controls or retry the command after a brief pause." |
| UC suggests that voice recognition should operate effectively in all environments, but SSTS mentions potential failure in noisy environments. | "The user must be seated in the vehicle with adequate microphone coverage and minimal background noise." |
| UC indicates clear confirmation of all settings adjustments, whereas SSTS does not specify visual confirmation alongside voice feedback. | "The system provides verbal confirmation of the executed action, e.g., 'Seat position adjusted' or 'Temperature set to 22 degrees Celsius.'" |
| UC expects the system to provide a seamless transition back to idle after every command, but SSTS suggests potential delays in the system exiting the interaction mode. | "The system can be re-activated at any time by the user speaking the activation phrase again." |
