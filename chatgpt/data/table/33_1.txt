| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC specifies multi-factor authentication after several failed attempts, but SSTS only mentions fallback methods without explicitly requiring multi-factor authentication. | "In the case of multiple failed authentication attempts, the system will lock the user out temporarily and may require additional verification, such as multi-factor authentication, before allowing further attempts." |
| UC requires a clear description of fallback methods in case of system downtime or failures, but SSTS lacks detailed handling of system downtime. | "In the case of a system failure or communication error between the authentication sub-system and the car's locking mechanism, the system will trigger a failure alert." |
| UC mentions that users should be able to retry after authentication failure with troubleshooting prompts, whereas SSTS only mentions retrying without providing detailed troubleshooting instructions. | "If authentication fails, the system prompts the user to retry the authentication process, offering alternatives (e.g., switch from fingerprint to PIN)." |
| UC requires the system to handle retries for biometric failures, but SSTS lacks specific troubleshooting steps or guidance for retrying biometric failures. | "The system prompts the user to retry the authentication, offering suggestions like cleaning the sensor, adjusting the position, or trying a different method." |
| SSTS does not specify the "Owner" role in its detailed descriptions of the user roles, while the UC mentions distinct user roles like "Owner," "Driver," and "Guest." | "The system must have user permission configurations that define roles such as owner, driver, or guest." |
