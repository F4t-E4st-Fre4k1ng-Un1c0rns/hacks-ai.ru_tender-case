|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS does not explicitly define the need for user authentication and authorization before remote access, which is mentioned in the UC. | "The user must have an authenticated account with the vehicle manufacturer’s mobile app platform, including appropriate permissions for remote access to the vehicle’s features." |
| SSTS does not specify detailed network requirements (e.g., bandwidth, latency), whereas UC mentions the need for stable connectivity to operate the system. | "The user’s mobile device must have an active internet connection (either Wi-Fi or cellular data)." |
| SSTS mentions basic "user interaction" as a trigger but does not clarify the types of input methods (manual, voice command, gestures) as required by the UC. | "The user opens the mobile app and successfully logs in to their account." |
| The trigger condition in SSTS assumes a single input method but does not account for multiple interaction modes (e.g., voice, gesture), as suggested in the UC. | "The user taps a control button on the app’s interface to initiate an action (e.g., locking the doors, adjusting the climate control, or tracking the vehicle’s location)." |
| SSTS does not define the error handling or feedback mechanism in as much detail as the UC, which calls for specific error messages and troubleshooting steps. | "The app will display an appropriate error message, such as 'Unable to connect to the vehicle' or 'Action failed due to poor signal.'" |
| SSTS does not clearly define the real-time status update behavior after user actions, whereas UC mentions that users should receive immediate feedback and confirmation of actions taken. | "Upon the user initiating an action, the app will display a confirmation message that the command has been received by the vehicle." |
| SSTS lacks specificity regarding the long-term operational behavior of the system (e.g., continuous communication for tracking or periodic updates), which is mentioned in the UC. | "If the user checks the vehicle’s location, the app will display the vehicle's current location on a map with real-time GPS updates." |
| The post-condition in SSTS does not include enough detail on updating the vehicle status after every action, such as providing a final status check or real-time verification of actions performed, as required by the UC. | "After the user performs an action (e.g., locking the vehicle), the vehicle's features are updated, and the app confirms the action with real-time feedback." |
