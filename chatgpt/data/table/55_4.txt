|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS lacks specification of active lane-change intervention, which is implied in the UC. | "The BSD system provides both visual and audible warnings to notify the driver when an object is detected within the blind spot zone, significantly reducing the risk of accidents." |
| SSTS does not mention automatic sensor calibration or the handling of misaligned sensors, as required in the UC. | "Calibration of the sensors must be completed after any vehicle maintenance, sensor repositioning, or significant changes in vehicle alignment." |
| SSTS does not specify the need for synchronization with the vehicle’s turn signal system to trigger alerts, as outlined in the UC. | "The system is triggered when the vehicle's turn signal is activated, signaling the driver's intent to change lanes or merge." |
| SSTS does not guarantee both visual and audible alerts under all conditions, as required by the UC. | "The system may generate a distinctive audible warning (beep), which increases in frequency as the hazard moves closer." |
| SSTS does not clearly specify the conditions under which alerts should stop once the hazard is cleared, as required in the UC. | "Once the object leaves the blind spot zone (or the driver cancels the lane change by turning off the indicator), the system will immediately deactivate the alerts." |
| SSTS lacks a clear process for notifying the driver about sensor obstruction, which the UC specifies. | "If sensors are obstructed (e.g., by dirt, ice, or heavy rain), the system will notify the driver through an error message on the dashboard, and the alerts will be disabled until the sensors are cleared." |
| SSTS does not provide a clear requirement for error messaging or notification when the system fails, as required by the UC. | "In the event of a system failure, the system will notify the driver through an error message and/or icon on the dashboard." |
