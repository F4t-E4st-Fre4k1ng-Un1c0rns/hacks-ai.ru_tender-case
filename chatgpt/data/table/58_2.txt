| The UC specifies automatic dynamic speed adjustments based on traffic signals, while the SSTS only mentions alerts and notifications about traffic signals without explicitly stating speed adjustments. | "Real-time adjustments to the vehicle’s speed and route based on traffic signal timings, real-time traffic conditions, and route optimization data." |
| The UC requires fully automated selection of optimal charging stations, but the SSTS indicates that user confirmation is needed for charging station selection. | "Notifications on the vehicle’s display for available charging stations, including location, availability, and optimal charging times." |
| The UC specifies interaction with smart road signs for real-time speed limit adjustments, whereas the SSTS only mentions alerts without specifying the automatic adjustment feature. | "Speed limit adjustments based on smart road sign communication, ensuring compliance with real-time regulations." |
| The UC mentions seamless fallback systems when V2I communication fails, while the SSTS does not clearly define a fallback system or alternative modes for continued operation. | "In this case, the system enters a fallback mode with limited functionality." |
| The UC requires automatic real-time system activation when infrastructure is available, but the SSTS suggests that the system requires user initiation for some features. | "The user sets a destination or begins navigating via the vehicle’s route planner, triggering the system to gather relevant infrastructure data." |
