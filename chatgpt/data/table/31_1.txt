| SSTS does not explicitly mention the need for real-time synchronization of user profiles with vehicle settings. | "The system requires that the vehicle's voice profile is pre-configured with the user’s preferences, such as seat position, climate control, and media choices." |
| SSTS does not specify that the system should handle multiple, simultaneous voice commands as expected by UC. | "The system will engage when the vehicle is stationary or in motion, provided the necessary safety protocols are met." |
| SSTS does not include details on how the system should manage error handling for personalized user settings or failures in retrieval. | "If a command is ambiguous or cannot be executed, the system will respond with a polite error message, prompting the user to repeat or clarify the request." |
| SSTS does not mention an automatic reset of settings after a failure or a troubleshooting process for recovery, as implied by the UC. | "In the case of a system error or failure to execute a command, the system will exit the current session and provide the user with instructions to troubleshoot or adjust settings manually." |
| SSTS lacks explicit mention of a fallback mechanism or manual override in case voice control fails, contrary to UC's full hands-free functionality requirement. | "The system will automatically exit voice command mode after a command is successfully executed, and the user will return to the main vehicle interface." |
| SSTS does not cover multi-language support in sufficient detail, which is part of UC's expected functionality for diverse user profiles. | "The system must support multiple languages or dialects as required by the vehicle's region." |
| SSTS does not mention the vehicle's readiness to handle all commands, including the simultaneous control of multiple settings (e.g., temperature and driving mode), as the UC suggests. | "Voice commands related to vehicle settings, such as climate adjustments, seat positions, and media controls, will automatically trigger the system." |
