| The UC mentions real-time algorithms for precise parking assistance, but the SSTS does not explicitly reference the use of these algorithms. | "The system uses a combination of sensors, cameras, and real-time processing algorithms to identify and analyze available parking spaces." |
| The UC describes that the system should notify the driver when parking is complete, but the SSTS does not specify the notification method. | "Once the system successfully parks the vehicle, it will stop the vehicle and notify the driver (via visual or auditory cue) that parking is complete." |
| The UC requires the system to automatically disengage after parking, but the SSTS does not clarify if the driver has to manually disengage in some cases. | "The system deactivates automatically after the parking process is completed, and the vehicle remains parked in the space." |
| The UC specifies that the system should be triggered automatically when detecting a valid parking space, but the SSTS includes manual activation, which is not mentioned in the UC. | "The system can also be manually triggered by the driver via the dashboard or steering wheel buttons." |
| The UC does not specify the condition where the system stops and notifies the driver in case of a malfunction, whereas the SSTS includes this condition. | "If the system encounters an obstruction or a malfunction in the sensors or cameras, it will notify the driver and exit, requiring manual control to park." |
| The UC mentions "low-speed motion," but the SSTS lacks clarity on whether the system can be activated while the vehicle is stopped. | "The vehicle must be traveling at a low speed (below 5 mph) when activating the system." |
