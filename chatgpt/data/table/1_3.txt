| The UC emphasizes user experience and interaction, while the SSTS is more technical and system-focused. | "The system is designed to share critical data such as vehicle speed, direction, braking status, and location, allowing vehicles to anticipate each other’s movements." (SSTS) |
| UC provides a broader description of outcomes (e.g., improved safety and traffic flow), but SSTS includes technical details about data exchange and system performance. | "Vehicles exchange data packets containing information such as current speed, location, heading, and braking status." (SSTS) |
| The UC specifies user-triggered actions in regular scenarios, while the SSTS defines conditions for automatic system activation without detailing the user's role. | "When a vehicle comes within the defined communication range (e.g., 300 meters) of another vehicle, the system initiates data exchange between them." (SSTS) |
| The UC discusses fallback scenarios in the context of user experience, but the SSTS includes technical terms related to system deactivation and failure conditions. | "If communication between vehicles is lost due to range or network issues, the system will cease data exchange and fall back to standard safety measures..." (SSTS) |
| The UC highlights high-level system outcomes like route recommendations, while the SSTS gives a more detailed technical explanation of system outputs. | "The system may provide alternate route recommendations to the driver." (SSTS) |
| The UC is more user-oriented and focuses on how users benefit from the V2V system, whereas the SSTS is more system-specific and defines measurable outputs. | "In response to alerts (e.g., sudden braking), the system may automatically adjust vehicle speed or braking to maintain a safe distance..." (SSTS) |
