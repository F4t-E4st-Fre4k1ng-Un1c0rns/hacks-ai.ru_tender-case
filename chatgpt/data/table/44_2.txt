| The SSTS allows the user to manually disable the reset feature, while the UC assumes the feature is always enabled. | "The **Automatic System Reset** feature is enabled by default and remains active unless manually disabled by the user through the vehicle's settings interface." |
| The SSTS acknowledges the possibility of a failed reset and provides instructions for further action, whereas the UC expects the reset to always resolve the issue without failure. | "If the reset is unsuccessful, the system will notify the user of the failure and provide instructions to attempt a manual reset or contact customer support for further assistance." |
| The SSTS only specifies certain faults as being resettable, limiting the range of malfunctions, while the UC implies the system should handle all faults automatically. | "The diagnostic software recognizes that the fault can be addressed through an automatic reset, rather than requiring manual troubleshooting or repair." |
| The SSTS requires the system to have network connectivity for downloading updates or patches during the reset, but the UC does not mention this dependency. | "The vehicle must have adequate power and network connectivity (e.g., Wi-Fi or mobile data) to download updates or patches if required during the reset process." |
