| The UC emphasizes the need for a "seamless and comfortable driving experience" through personalization, but the SSTS focuses mainly on speed sensitivity and following distance, lacking emphasis on comfort. | "The driver’s selected preferences (speed sensitivity, following distance) are immediately applied to the system, and the vehicle’s speed is controlled accordingly." |
| The UC outlines specific road conditions required for optimal ACC operation, but the SSTS only generally mentions "clear and free of obstacles" without specifying lane conditions or road type. | "The vehicle should be in motion, and the road conditions must be clear and free of obstacles that may interfere with ACC functionality." |
| The UC specifies that the system should react dynamically to surrounding traffic, but the SSTS does not mention dynamic adjustment based on rapid changes in traffic behavior. | "The system provides visual feedback via the infotainment display or dashboard, showing the current settings and any adjustments made." |
| The UC outlines a comprehensive failure scenario where road conditions, system malfunctions, or other factors affect ACC operation, but the SSTS mainly focuses on system errors without addressing external conditions like heavy traffic or road obstructions. | "If the ACC system detects a malfunction or error (such as a failure in sensor functionality), it will disengage, and the driver will be alerted via an on-screen notification or audio alert." |
| The UC describes a continuous, personalized experience even after system customization, while the SSTS focuses more on system disengagement in certain conditions rather than reinforcing user satisfaction. | "The system will disengage if the vehicle reaches a speed too low for the ACC to function effectively or if the vehicle is in a situation where ACC cannot maintain control." |
