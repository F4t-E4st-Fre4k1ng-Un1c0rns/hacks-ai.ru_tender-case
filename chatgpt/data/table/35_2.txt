| The UC specifies that the system should track driving behavior (e.g., lane changes), but SSTS focuses only on eye and head monitoring. | "The system uses a combination of in-vehicle cameras and sensors to assess the driver's alertness." |
| UC requires the system to be initialized before driving, but SSTS mentions activation upon ignition without specifying the initialization step. | "The system is enabled when the vehicle's ignition is turned on." |
| UC states that the system should provide continuous monitoring, including alerts when fatigue signs are not present, but SSTS only describes alert issuance after fatigue detection. | "During normal operation, the system silently continues to monitor the driver’s state without providing output unless fatigue signs are detected." |
| UC specifies a fallback mode in case of failure but does not clarify the lack of feedback for the driver when the system can't detect the driver; SSTS only mentions a warning message without specifying any further action. | "A warning message will be displayed, advising the driver to adjust their seat position or remove obstructions for accurate monitoring." |
| UC indicates that alerts should be issued continuously until acknowledged, whereas SSTS does not clarify how long alerts persist. | "The alert continues until the driver acknowledges it or the system determines the alert condition has passed." |
| UC mentions taking action for system errors and prompts for manual checks, but SSTS only logs the issue and enters standby mode without detailing how manual intervention should proceed. | "The system will log the issue and notify the driver with a message indicating the nature of the problem... The system will then enter a standby mode until the issue is resolved." |
