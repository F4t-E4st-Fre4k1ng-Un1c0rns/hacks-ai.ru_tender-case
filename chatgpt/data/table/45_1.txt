| UC specifies mood-based recommendations (e.g., emotional state via biometric or voice-tone analysis), but SSTS only mentions using "historical preferences" and "driving conditions" without clear reference to mood detection. | "The system should be capable of detecting the user’s emotional state via biometric or voice-tone analysis to provide mood-based recommendations." |
| UC mentions external factors like weather or road type affecting recommendations, but SSTS only references "internal sensors" such as speed and time of day. | "The system detects changes in driving conditions, such as a drop in speed, change in location (highway vs. city), or time of day, prompting it to offer context-specific recommendations." |
| UC implies the system should handle both online and offline modes (e.g., when no internet connection is available), but SSTS heavily relies on an internet connection for streaming content. | "The system requires stable internet connectivity (Wi-Fi or mobile data) to stream content from external services. In case of no connection, the system should fall back on locally stored content." |
| UC emphasizes informing the user of errors (e.g., lost connectivity) and offering an alternative, but SSTS does not clearly state user notifications for errors. | "If external streaming services are unavailable (e.g., due to connectivity issues), the system will default to a pre-loaded playlist or other local content, notifying the user of the issue." |
| UC mentions feedback should improve future recommendations, but SSTS does not explicitly describe how user feedback (thumbs up/thumbs down) directly influences the learning algorithm. | "Upon receiving user feedback (thumbs up/thumbs down), the system records the feedback and refines future recommendations, improving its accuracy and relevance." |
