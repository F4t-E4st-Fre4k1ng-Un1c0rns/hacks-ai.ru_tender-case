| UC specifies real-time driver alerts for sudden hazards like a vehicle braking suddenly; however, SSTS lacks explicit real-time alert descriptions. | "The system processes the received data and generates real-time alerts for the driver, including visual and audible warnings for potential hazards." |
| UC requires detailed fallback to collision sensors and manual braking if V2V communication fails, whereas SSTS only briefly mentions fallback without specific sensors or manual control protocols. | "Communication is suspended if the vehicle's V2V system encounters a malfunction or loss of power, and the vehicle switches to basic safety functions like collision sensors and manual control." |
| UC mentions specific environmental conditions (e.g., heavy weather) that could interfere with V2V communication, but SSTS lacks these details, only describing "loss of signal." | "The system will enter a standby mode when no nearby V2V-equipped vehicles are within range." |
| UC requires automatic activation of V2V communication upon vehicle start and readiness without user intervention, while SSTS implies activation depends on both vehicle power and motion. | "The V2V system is activated when the vehicle is powered on and in motion." |
| UC specifies that alerts continue as long as hazards persist, but SSTS does not clarify if continuous alerts are active until resolved. | "The system continues to deliver situational feedback, such as traffic congestion, road condition updates, and upcoming hazards, throughout the driving session." |
