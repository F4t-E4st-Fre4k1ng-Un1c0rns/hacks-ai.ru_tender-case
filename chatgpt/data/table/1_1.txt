| SSTS provides technical detail about communication protocols and data exchange intervals, while UC only broadly describes system functionality. | “This system operates on dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) and/or cellular V2X protocols, allowing vehicles to transmit critical information such as speed, position, direction, and hazard data.” |

| UC focuses on user interaction scenarios, whereas SSTS specifies technical enabling conditions like range and signal requirements. | “Vehicles must be within a 300-meter range for data transmission stability.” |

| UC describes general alert scenarios, but SSTS includes precise trigger conditions, such as speed thresholds and environmental constraints. | “Vehicle speed exceeding 10 km/h to enable dynamic hazard and speed data exchange.” |

| UC lists outcome for drivers (e.g., warning prompts), while SSTS details specific data transmission intervals and latency requirements. | “Real-time transmission of vehicle data, including speed, direction, and location, at intervals of 100 ms.” |

| UC discusses fallback behavior in case of failure, but SSTS specifies exit conditions based on hardware faults, signal strength, and security protocols. | “Security protocols detect unauthorized access attempts or data irregularities, leading to session termination for safety.” |
