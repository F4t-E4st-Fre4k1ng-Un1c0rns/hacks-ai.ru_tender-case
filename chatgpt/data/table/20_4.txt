| The UC requires actionable recommendations (e.g., detours, speed adjustments) to be provided, while SSTS only mentions the display of alerts without specifying detailed guidance for the driver. | "Display the emergency alert on the dashboard screen, including key details such as the type of emergency (e.g., road hazard, weather alert, accident), the severity level, and relevant safety recommendations." |
| The UC specifies that the system must be operational at all times and fully available, while SSTS allows for system unavailability without a clear recovery process or fallback option. | "If the emergency alert system detects a resolution of the emergency or receives updated information indicating the alert is no longer valid, the system will deactivate the alert." |
| UC requires clear, structured user interactions with follow-up actions after an alert, but SSTS does not outline detailed user steps after the alert is received. | "Once the emergency alert has been acknowledged by the driver or if the alert’s duration has expired, the system will clear the alert from the dashboard display." |
| UC stresses continuous readiness for emergency alerts, while SSTS mentions system downtime without a clear resolution or recovery process. | "If the emergency alert system detects a resolution of the emergency or receives updated information indicating the alert is no longer valid, the system will deactivate the alert." |
| UC mandates that the alert system contributes directly to driver safety by reducing risk, but SSTS does not explicitly link the system’s output to enhanced safety outcomes. | "Once the alert is resolved, the system will return to normal operations." |
