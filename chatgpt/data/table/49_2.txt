|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC requires immediate real-time alert notifications upon unauthorized movement, while SSTS allows for potential delays in notifications due to network or signal issues. | "The system provides an alert notification but may include delays depending on network connectivity or vehicle conditions. There may be lag time before the system responds to a theft detection." |
| UC specifies that the system must be active and functional at all times, but SSTS allows for intermittent or partial functionality in case of connectivity issues. | "The system can operate intermittently or with reduced functionality if these modules are partially active or experiencing connectivity issues." |
| UC demands real-time tracking and alerting capabilities, whereas SSTS specifies that alerts may not always be in real-time due to potential signal loss or network delays. | "While the system outputs location data, there may be delays or limited functionality during signal loss or temporary connectivity failures. The alert may not always be in real time and could be affected by technical limitations such as cellular network delays." |
| UC expects detailed and immediate alerts for unauthorized movement, but SSTS specifies that certain theft scenarios (e.g., low-speed movements) may not immediately trigger alerts. | "The system triggers alerts based on location shifts or user-requested checks, but may not immediately alert the user for certain theft scenarios such as if the vehicle is moved in a low-speed manner or when no clear boundary is defined." |
| UC specifies immediate user notification for system errors or failures, while SSTS may fail silently or not immediately notify the user of issues. | "The system may fail silently or take time to notify the user of issues; exit conditions may not immediately communicate system errors, leaving the user uncertain of system status." |
