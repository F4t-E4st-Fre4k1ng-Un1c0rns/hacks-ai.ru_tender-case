|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC requires real-time personalized recommendations at the end of each driving session; SSTS mentions general recommendations but not automatic, session-ending recommendations. | "System-generated recommendations for improving driving efficiency, such as reducing acceleration, driving at steady speeds, or utilizing eco-driving modes." |
| UC assumes full system calibration is completed and activated before usage, while SSTS indicates potential calibration delays or issues preventing full activation. | "The vehicle must undergo an initial calibration to ensure that all sensors and tracking functionalities are set up correctly for optimal performance." |
| UC specifies immediate, real-time feedback during the drive; SSTS allows for potential delays in real-time feedback due to network or processing issues. | "Real-time display of current energy efficiency metrics, such as miles per kilowatt-hour, fuel economy trends, and instantaneous consumption data." |
| UC expects system failure notifications to be resolved remotely or with a quick workaround; SSTS mentions potential service center visits for some issues. | "If the system encounters an error or malfunction (e.g., sensor failure, connectivity issue), it enters a fail-safe mode, alerting the user that full functionality may be unavailable until the issue is resolved." |
| UC requires complete reports after every drive; SSTS mentions occasional issues with generating complete reports due to synchronization problems. | "The system will temporarily hold the generated reports and synchronize them once the connection is restored." |
| UC mentions automatic report generation and user notifications at the end of each trip; SSTS indicates a need for user-triggered data collection and report generation. | "If the user requests an efficiency report via the mobile app or the vehicle’s onboard display, the system triggers data processing to generate the report." |
