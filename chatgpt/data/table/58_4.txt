| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The SSTS does not mention personalized energy management based on user behavior, which is required in the UC. | *"Charging status updates, including real-time battery levels and suggested charging stations along the route based on vehicle energy needs."* |
| The SSTS does not specify the need for specific communication protocols (e.g., DSRC, C-V2X, 5G), which are required by the UC. | *"The surrounding infrastructure supports V2I communication protocols, such as DSRC, 5G, or C-V2X, ensuring compatibility with the vehicle’s system."* (This is mentioned, but lacks the precise requirement for protocol selection.) |
| The UC specifies that V2I communication should automatically update charging schedules based on the user’s driving patterns, but the SSTS does not explicitly cover this. | *"Charging status updates, including real-time battery levels and suggested charging stations along the route based on vehicle energy needs."* (Does not mention charging schedule optimization based on user behavior.) |
| The SSTS does not mention predictive maintenance notifications based on infrastructure feedback, which is required in the UC. | *"Predictive maintenance notifications based on infrastructure feedback (e.g., alerts for potential vehicle issues triggered by road conditions or other connected systems)."* (The quote provides a basic reference but does not specify the depth of predictive features mentioned in the UC.) |
| The SSTS lacks an explicit mention of route optimization based on V2I infrastructure even when not triggered by the driver, which is implied in the UC. | *"The vehicle detects route optimization opportunities, such as upcoming smart traffic signals or available charging stations, based on the vehicle’s current location and destination."* (The UC implies proactive system adjustments without manual activation.) |
| The SSTS does not include specific mention of the "loss of infrastructure connectivity," a key scenario addressed in the UC. | *"The vehicle loses connectivity to the infrastructure due to technical issues (e.g., signal loss or temporary infrastructure failure), and the system automatically defaults to conventional navigation without V2I enhancements."* (This response is more general compared to the UC's specific requirements.) |
