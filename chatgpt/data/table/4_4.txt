| UC focuses on user-centric interactions and personalization, while SSTS highlights technical limitations and non-compliance. | "The system may be limited in hardware resources, such as processing speed and memory, impacting its ability to handle multiple users or settings simultaneously." |
| UC expects the system to reliably save and apply user preferences, but SSTS mentions incomplete data saving and inconsistent behavior. | "User preferences, such as audio settings or display themes, may be partially saved, but incomplete data storage could lead to inconsistencies in system behavior during subsequent interactions." |
| UC describes successful user interaction with clear feedback, whereas SSTS highlights failure to provide adequate feedback and error handling. | "The system may exit the preferences menu without confirming whether all changes have been applied, leaving the user uncertain about the status of their preferences." |
| UC specifies seamless, intuitive user experience, but SSTS indicates that the system might not respond to user input consistently due to software issues. | "The system fails to recognize user input in some cases due to compatibility issues between the input device and the software." |
| UC implies full system compliance and effective functionality, while SSTS mentions non-compliance with standards and system limitations. | "The current version does not meet full compliance with industry standards in terms of responsiveness, system integration, and user data storage." |
| UC assumes that user preferences are stored and applied across sessions, but SSTS notes intermittent connectivity and failure to store preferences. | "Connectivity to backend systems for storing preferences is intermittent, which may result in preferences not being saved." |
| UC suggests that the system provides clear confirmation messages to users, but SSTS mentions the lack of proper feedback or confirmation. | "The system may not provide adequate feedback, such as confirmation messages or audible prompts, regarding saved preferences." |
