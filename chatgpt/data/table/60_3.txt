| UC specifies automatic adjustments based on weather and driving mode, while SSTS does not consistently support these features. | "The system detects time of day to apply minimal adjustments to the lighting, though further automatic adjustments (based on weather or driving mode) are not consistently supported." |
| UC requires seamless and smooth transitions when changing lighting modes, but SSTS mentions occasional delays. | "Lighting transitions occur, though there may be delays or disruptions, particularly with manual customization." |
| UC outlines that user preferences should always be saved reliably, but SSTS indicates that settings may not always be saved correctly. | "The system saves user preferences and recalls them on subsequent uses, although this functionality may experience occasional errors." |
| UC specifies that exit conditions should clearly confirm saving or reverting settings, while SSTS describes a vague process for unsaved settings. | "Once the user exits the lighting settings, the system saves the changes or returns to the default lighting mode if no changes were made." |
| UC requires that the system adapt lighting based on driving modes automatically, while SSTS only supports limited automatic adjustment based on time of day. | "The system detects time of day to apply minimal adjustments to the lighting, though further automatic adjustments (based on weather or driving mode) are not consistently supported." |
