| The underpinning contract expects the system to automatically intervene in all imminent collision risks, whereas the SSTS limits automatic intervention to "critical" situations. | "The system can autonomously apply emergency braking or steering to avoid a collision." |
| UC assumes the system is always operational once activated, whereas the SSTS specifies that the system requires manual activation by the driver. | "The system must be activated by the driver through the vehicle’s user interface, which could be an infotainment screen or physical controls." |
| The underpinning contract implies real-time detection and response to all potential threats, but the SSTS limits triggering to threats within a specific threshold (e.g., time-to-collision or minimum safe distance). | "The system’s analysis algorithm detects a risk of collision based on the relative speed, trajectory, and proximity of the detected object." |
| The underpinning contract requires the system to continue monitoring after an alert or intervention without driver reactivation, while the SSTS mentions the system "resumes normal operation" after an intervention, implying manual or vehicle-driven reset. | "The system resets and resumes normal operation, continuously monitoring for new threats." |
| UC expects comprehensive scenario-specific output descriptions, but the SSTS provides a more general explanation of output types without detailed case-specific responses. | "If a risk of collision is detected, the system will provide visual alerts (flashing lights on the dashboard or heads-up display), auditory warnings (beeps or voice alerts), and haptic feedback (vibrations in the steering wheel or seat)." |
