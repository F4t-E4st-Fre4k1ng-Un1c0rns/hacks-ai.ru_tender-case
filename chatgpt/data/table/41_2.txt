|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The UC specifies real-time updates and notifications without delay, but the SSTS is ambiguous about the timeliness of notifications. | "The system generates real-time notifications for the user when a vehicle enters or exits a geofence." |
| The UC specifies that geofence events should be logged with detailed tracking data, but the SSTS lacks clarity on the exact data to be logged (e.g., vehicle speed, geofence name). | "A log entry is created for each geofence event, including vehicle ID, geofence ID, timestamp, and action (entry/exit)." |
| The UC mentions vehicle speed as a possible trigger for alerts within geofences, but the SSTS adds "crossing multiple geofences in a specified time frame," which is not explicitly stated in the UC. | "A vehicle crosses multiple geofences within a specified time frame (rapid transitions)." |
| The UC expects only basic geofence triggers (entry/exit), but the SSTS introduces additional triggers such as speed limit violations and restricted zone violations, which may not be required according to the UC. | "A vehicle exceeds the predefined speed limit within the geofence area." |
| The UC mentions user access roles with administrative rights, but the SSTS only states that users with the appropriate access rights can configure geofences, lacking the detail of "admin" or "fleet manager" roles. | "Users must have appropriate access rights (admin or fleet manager role) to create, configure, and manage geofences." |
| The UC specifies that the system must alert users in real-time when geofences are entered or exited, while the SSTS adds report generation functionality, which is not specifically mentioned in the UC. | "The system generates a report summarizing geofence events, including times and vehicle data." |
| The UC implies that the system should be responsive and alert users immediately when geofences are triggered, while the SSTS mentions that "alerts are sent according to the defined parameters," which could imply a delay. | "Alerts are triggered based on user-configured parameters (e.g., vehicle speed, entry/exit events, or boundary violations)." |
