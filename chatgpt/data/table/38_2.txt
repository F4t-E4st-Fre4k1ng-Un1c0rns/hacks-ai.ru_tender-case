| SSTS lacks a detailed description of the specific behavior being monitored for unsafe driving, such as lane changes and other driving patterns as required by the UC. | "The system tracks driving metrics such as speed, acceleration, braking force, lane detection, and GPS positioning." |
| SSTS does not explicitly mention the system's need for manual calibration or activation protocols as required by the UC. | "The system must be calibrated prior to use to ensure accurate monitoring and feedback." |
| SSTS mentions that the system starts when the vehicle begins moving but does not explicitly state that it triggers at ignition, which was a specific requirement in the UC. | "The system is activated automatically when the vehicle’s engine is turned on and the vehicle starts moving." |
| The feedback output in SSTS does not fully align with the UC’s requirement of providing detailed areas for improvement after each trip. | "After each trip, the system generates a summary report that includes a safety score, a breakdown of driving behaviors (e.g., braking, acceleration), and specific alerts for unsafe driving patterns." |
| SSTS provides exit conditions but does not mention that system failure or troubleshooting procedures should be emphasized, as specified in the UC. | "The system will stop tracking and providing feedback once the vehicle has been stationary for more than 5 minutes or if the driver manually exits the system interface." |
