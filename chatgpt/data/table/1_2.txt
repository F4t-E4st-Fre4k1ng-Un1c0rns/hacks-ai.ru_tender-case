|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC emphasizes **user-oriented goals** and **driver benefits**, while SSTS focuses more on **technical functionalities** without detailing direct user benefits. | "The Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication system enables real-time data exchange between vehicles, facilitating improved situational awareness, collision avoidance, and traffic management." |
| UC specifies **detailed interaction scenarios** (main and alternative) for regular and failure cases, whereas SSTS only includes **general enabling and trigger conditions** for the system. | "Activation of the V2V system by the driver, either manually or automatically upon vehicle startup." |
| SSTS describes **error handling only minimally**, while UC provides an **alternative scenario** for handling connectivity issues and user notifications. | "In cases of connectivity loss, signal interference, or system malfunction, the V2V system will display an error message and pause communication until reconnected or reset." |
| UC requires **specific postconditions** focusing on the successful result of user actions, while SSTS mainly lists **exit conditions** related to system deactivation or error handling without defining user outcomes. | "The V2V system automatically deactivates when the vehicle is turned off or leaves the communication range of other V2V-enabled vehicles." |
| UC assumes **full compliance with data security and privacy standards**, whereas SSTS, at a "Largely Compliant" level, only mentions data retention and privacy generally, without specifying encryption or data security methods. | "System records exchanged data for incident analysis and regulatory compliance (if applicable), adhering to data retention policies and privacy regulations." |
