| V2V system occasionally experiences latency in data transmission during high-density traffic, potentially impacting real-time hazard notifications. This does not fully meet the UC's expectation of seamless real-time alerts. | "The system may experience occasional latency in data transmission during high-density traffic, which could affect real-time hazard notifications in certain conditions." |
| SSTS specifies a limited proximity range under adverse weather conditions, whereas the UC expects consistent proximity effectiveness without mention of weather limitations. | "The V2V system has a limited proximity range under certain weather conditions, which may reduce the effective communication distance compared to optimal standards." |
| SSTS indicates that hazard detection is less sensitive in complex road layouts or low-speed maneuvers, potentially causing delays in alert frequency, whereas the UC specifies immediate alerts under all conditions. | "In scenarios with complex road layouts or low-speed maneuvers, the system’s ability to detect vehicle interactions may be less sensitive, leading to delayed or reduced alert frequency." |
| Under heavy data load, the alert system may experience delays, impacting immediacy in hazard response, whereas the UC specifies real-time alert generation. | "The alert system may display delayed notifications under heavy data load conditions, which can slightly reduce the immediacy of hazard alerts provided to the driver." |
| The SSTS mentions a need for manual reset in specific cases of connectivity loss, while the UC implies an automatic system reset after vehicles exit the communication range. | "Under specific connectivity interruptions, the V2V system may require a manual reset by the driver to fully return to standby mode, rather than automatically transitioning after exiting a vehicle interaction range." |
