| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS restricts geofence creation to predefined templates and does not allow freeform drawing of geofence boundaries, which is required in the UC. | "The system can only create geofences using predefined templates or automated system-generated boundaries, but manual drawing is not supported." |
| SSTS limits notification options to email only, whereas the UC specifies that notifications should be sent via email, SMS, or app push notifications. | "The system generates and sends a notification to the user when a vehicle enters or exits the defined geofence. Notifications can be sent via email only." |
| SSTS imposes restrictions on the size and complexity of geofence areas, which is not mentioned in the UC. | "The system imposes a strict limit on the maximum allowable area for geofences and does not support geofences with more than 100 points." |
| SSTS mentions that GPS tracking may be delayed by up to 30 seconds or more, which contradicts the UC's expectation of real-time tracking for geofence events. | "GPS tracking may be delayed by up to 30 seconds or more, depending on network conditions or vehicle status." |
| SSTS allows geofences to be assigned only to a single vehicle at a time, contrary to the UC, which allows geofences to be applied to multiple vehicles. | "The system supports applying geofences to only a single vehicle at a time." |
| SSTS limits event logs to the past 24 hours, whereas the UC specifies that geofence events should be logged and available for long-term historical analysis. | "Event logging is only available for the past 24 hours and is not accessible beyond that period." |
| SSTS does not mention the complete availability of geofence management features, while the UC assumes continuous operation. | "The geofence management interface must be operational, and map services must be available for creating geofence boundaries." (This implies dependency on external map services which may be unavailable.) |
