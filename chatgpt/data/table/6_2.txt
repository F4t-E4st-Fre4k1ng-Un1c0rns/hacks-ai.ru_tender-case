| UC specifies the system should provide personalized navigation based on user preferences (e.g., driving style, historical routes), but SSTS only mentions general route adjustments based on real-time data. | "The system is designed to ensure a seamless hands-free experience, with the ability to recognize natural language commands for setting destinations, checking traffic conditions, and adjusting routes based on real-time data." |
| UC mentions that the system should allow easy switching between voice commands and manual input, but SSTS lacks clarity on this seamless transition between input methods. | "The system must receive a valid voice command for the start of navigation, such as a destination input." |
| UC emphasizes the system should provide detailed traffic updates, including specific queries like "How far to the next turn?", but SSTS only mentions general traffic data and alternate route suggestions. | "The system will offer alternate route options, showing estimated times of arrival (ETA) and distances based on real-time traffic data." |
| UC expects the system to handle automatic navigation stop due to issues like signal loss, but SSTS does not provide a clear auto-stop functionality in such cases. | "If the GPS signal is lost or there is a system malfunction, the navigation will be paused, and the user will be informed of the issue." |
| UC specifies that the system should dynamically adjust navigation based on user interaction and preferences, but SSTS lacks detailed dynamic reactivity beyond traffic issues. | "During navigation, the system will give turn-by-turn voice instructions and display visual directions on the screen." |
