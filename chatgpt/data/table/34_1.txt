|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The UC specifies that the user should configure app preferences and the system should display the third-party apps once detected, but the SSTS does not mention user customization or app preference configuration. | "The user must grant necessary permissions to the infotainment system, such as Bluetooth or data access, to enable app integration." |
| The UC emphasizes the need for smooth user experience with seamless app interaction and safety while driving, but the SSTS focuses more on technical connectivity and compatibility. | "The system will continue to allow interaction with the app as long as the app is active, ensuring that user actions (e.g., entering a destination, changing music) are executed correctly." |
| The UC specifies returning to the main menu or a previous screen after app exit, while the SSTS only mentions the default state without emphasizing the user's return to the main infotainment menu. | "The system will reset or return to a default state once the user disconnects their device or the system is turned off." |
| The UC outlines user interactions with the system (voice commands, touch control, and steering wheel control), but the SSTS does not specify steering wheel control as part of the user interaction scenario. | "The user selects a third-party app through the infotainment system interface using touch controls, voice commands." |
| The UC discusses error handling for app failures (e.g., app incompatibility, network issues), but the SSTS only mentions app session closing without detailing network error handling or specific user notifications for failures. | "In the event of a connectivity issue, the app will pause or close, and the system will display a message indicating the error, such as 'Connection lost' or 'App unavailable.'" |
