| UC expects the system to restore normal function without user intervention in all cases, but SSTS allows for user involvement if the reset fails. | "If the reset is unsuccessful, the system logs the failure and generates an alert for the user to follow manual intervention procedures (e.g., restart the vehicle or contact support)." |
| UC assumes no prerequisites for enabling the reset function, while SSTS lists specific enabling conditions (e.g., activated in settings and compatible software version). | "The Automatic System Reset feature must be activated in the vehicle’s settings, either by default or through user configuration." |
| UC assumes the reset process will handle all failures autonomously, while SSTS only triggers resets for major failures (e.g., freezes, crashes), excluding minor issues. | "A system failure or freeze is detected within any core in-car technology module (e.g., infotainment, navigation, connectivity)." |
| UC implies the reset will always be successful, but SSTS provides an option for manual intervention if the reset fails. | "If the reset is unsuccessful, the system logs the failure and generates an alert for the user to follow manual intervention procedures." |
| UC does not mention manual reset procedures or logging of failed attempts, while SSTS includes these as part of the exit conditions. | "The system logs the reset attempt and provides diagnostic information to assist with future troubleshooting." |
