| SSTS does not specify the dynamic adjustment of headlights based on vehicle speed or complex traffic scenarios. | "The system adjusts the intensity and direction of headlights based primarily on time of day and ambient light but lacks advanced adjustments for vehicle speed and complex traffic scenarios." |
| SSTS does not include advanced weather-related light adjustments such as fog or snow. | "The system detects reduced visibility conditions, including but not limited to heavy rain, fog, or snow." (Does not fully comply with the UC expectation for dynamic weather-related adjustments) |
| SSTS does not fully specify recovery or troubleshooting instructions in the event of system failure, leaving user action limited to basic notifications. | "The system will provide an error message or notification in the vehicle’s dashboard if a malfunction or critical issue arises, guiding the user to take appropriate actions such as visiting a service center." |
| SSTS lacks detailed recovery steps for temporary system failures, such as sensor misalignment. | "The system enters manual mode if a malfunction is detected (e.g., sensor failure, software crash), and the driver is notified to take control of the headlights manually." |
| SSTS does not mention automatic adjustment based on road curvature for all driving conditions as expected by UC. | "Headlight direction automatically adjusts based on the steering angle of the vehicle, improving visibility when navigating curves or turns." (Lacks full implementation of dynamic road curvature adjustments.) |
