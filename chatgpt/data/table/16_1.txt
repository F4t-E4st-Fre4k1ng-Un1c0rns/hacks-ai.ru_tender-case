| SSTS lacks detailed handling for failure recovery and manual override, which is specified in UC. | "If the system is unable to respond to commands due to a malfunction (e.g., microphone failure, recognition error), it will notify the user that the system is unavailable and advise using manual controls as a fallback." |
| SSTS does not explicitly guarantee confirmation of every climate action, as required in UC. | "The system will process the user’s voice command and perform the requested action, such as setting the temperature to a specific value (e.g., 'Set the temperature to 22°C'), adjusting the fan speed, or changing the air distribution mode (e.g., 'Direct air to the feet')." |
| SSTS does not specify full accuracy of voice recognition under varying conditions, as implied in UC. | "The system requires a vehicle-specific voice profile for optimized performance, which must be set up by the user before first use." |
| SSTS does not provide the same level of flexibility in language support, as implied in UC. | "The voice recognition software must be trained for the primary user’s language and accent, or support multiple languages with a fallback mode." |
| SSTS does not include a detailed description of how the system will handle and notify the user of unrecognized commands as expected in UC. | "If the user encounters an issue or failure, such as an unrecognized command, it will notify the user with an appropriate message (e.g., 'Sorry, I didn’t catch that. Please repeat your command')." |
