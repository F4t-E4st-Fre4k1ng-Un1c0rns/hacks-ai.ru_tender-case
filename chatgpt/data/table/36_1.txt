| The UC specifies **handling of multiple simultaneous device connections**, whereas SSTS only mentions automatic pairing and reconnection of previously paired devices without emphasizing management of multiple devices at once. | "The system will prioritize and pair with the previously connected devices first, managing up to three simultaneous Bluetooth connections..." |
| The UC assumes **automatic Bluetooth pairing without user permission** once the system is set up, while the SSTS mentions **user permission for pairing**. | "User permissions must allow the vehicle system to automatically pair with Bluetooth devices without requiring additional confirmation or manual input after initial setup." |
| The UC expects **automatic pairing without user input**, even for first-time pairing, while the SSTS implies that **manual input may be required** when pairing new devices. | "If no previously paired devices are found, the system will prompt the user to either enable Bluetooth on the device or manually initiate the pairing process." |
| The UC requires that the system should **maintain uninterrupted connectivity for multiple devices** throughout vehicle operation, but the SSTS lacks clarity on handling **continuous device management** during ongoing use. | "The system will enter a standby mode once all pairing tasks are complete..." |
| The UC expects the system to **notify users of successful pairing and immediately enable usage** of all devices. The SSTS states the system will "retain the connection" but lacks emphasis on **immediate usability of all paired devices** without further action from the user. | "The system will maintain an active connection for all paired devices, and users can seamlessly switch between them..." |
| The UC mentions that devices should be **automatically reconnected when in range**, but the SSTS includes **retry mechanisms** in case of failure, which is not mentioned in the UC. | "If the system encounters an error during pairing or connection, it will notify the user of the failure..." |
