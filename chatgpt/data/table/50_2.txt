| SSTS specifies that the vehicle requires manual confirmation to begin the parking session, which contradicts the "automatic" initiation described in the UC. | "The user confirms the payment authorization through the vehicle’s interface (manual intervention required in certain scenarios)." |
| SSTS mentions compatibility with only RFID communication, while the UC specifies support for multiple communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth, NFC). | "The system uses RFID communication technology to interact with compatible parking meters or management systems." |
| SSTS indicates that there can be delays in payment confirmation, which is not in line with the UC’s requirement for immediate confirmation. | "Upon successful payment, the vehicle interface displays a confirmation message to the user, indicating the payment was successful... A delay of up to 30 seconds may occur in cases of low connectivity." |
| SSTS requires manual validation to exit the parking in certain scenarios, whereas the UC states that no further interaction should be needed after payment confirmation. | "If the system experiences connectivity issues or a failure in payment authorization, the user is notified via the vehicle interface and prompted to pay manually at a kiosk or via mobile app." |
| SSTS does not mention real-time updates to the parking system in all scenarios, which is a key requirement in the UC for ensuring payment is reflected instantly. | "The parking session is marked as paid and active in the parking system, with a grace period allowed for users to leave without further charge." |
