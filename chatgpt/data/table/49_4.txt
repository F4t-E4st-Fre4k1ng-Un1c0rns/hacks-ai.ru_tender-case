| UC specifies continuous real-time location tracking with immediate theft detection, whereas SSTS only mentions location updates with potential delays. | "The system provides real-time location updates on the user’s device, with a map view that reflects the current position of the vehicle." |
| UC requires seamless communication with security services, while SSTS mentions basic alerting without external service integration. | "The system sends an immediate notification to the user, including the exact location of the vehicle and the option to contact security services." |
| UC specifies automatic activation of the tracking system by default, but SSTS notes that tracking is only triggered when the app is open or the vehicle is started. | "The sub-System triggers real-time location tracking as soon as the vehicle is started and moving. The location data is continuously updated and displayed on the user’s device." |
| UC mandates background tracking functionality, while SSTS only provides tracking while the app is open and active. | "Real-time tracking is triggered when the app is open and actively used; however, there is no background tracking functionality when the app is closed or if the user is not logged in." |
| UC requires automatic theft alerts and resolution with immediate actions like vehicle locking, while SSTS mentions delayed alerts and only manual responses. | "The system sends an immediate notification to the user, including the exact location of the vehicle and the option to contact security services." |
| UC specifies continuous tracking and immediate action on theft, but SSTS only allows tracking and alerts if there is a signal or GPS connection. | "If the vehicle exits a predefined geofenced area or is moved without authorization, an immediate alert and security response are triggered." |
| UC requires real-time background tracking and theft detection even in low signal conditions, but SSTS only triggers theft detection if significant movement is detected. | "The system may fail to detect or alert the user if the vehicle is moved out of range or if the GPS signal is weak, leading to undetected theft events." |
