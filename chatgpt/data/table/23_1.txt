| UC specifies that the system should allow interaction with social media during driving with a focus on non-distracting functionality, but the SSTS restricts interaction to "Park" mode only. | "The vehicle must be in 'Park' mode to allow full interaction with the social media integration." |
| UC mentions a detailed user experience, including viewing full posts, while the SSTS does not explicitly confirm full viewing capabilities beyond feeds. | "Display of social media feeds from the linked accounts on the infotainment screen, including posts, images, and videos." |
| UC requires explicit authentication for each session or when switching accounts, but the SSTS only mentions initial login without re-authentication details. | "The user must have active social media accounts and be logged into them through the infotainment system." |
| UC specifies the use of voice commands to interact with social media content, but the SSTS only mentions voice commands for liking, commenting, and sharing, without clearly addressing the interaction with viewing content. | "Real-time interaction with social media, allowing the user to like, comment, and share posts through voice commands or touch interface." |
| UC expects dynamic interaction with real-time content updates, but the SSTS is more limited and does not confirm full browsing capability during the session. | "Display of social media feeds from the linked accounts on the infotainment screen, including posts, images, and videos." |
| UC suggests automatic logout after inactivity, with clear user session management, while SSTS lacks clarity about session duration limits and management after interruptions. | "The system automatically logs out the user after a predefined period of inactivity to ensure privacy and security." |
