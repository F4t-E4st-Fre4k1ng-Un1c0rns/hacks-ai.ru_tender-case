| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SSTS lacks explicit confirmation of payment through the vehicle interface, as required by the UC. | "A confirmation message is displayed on the vehicle’s interface indicating the successful payment of the parking fee." |
| UC specifies a detailed error handling procedure, while SSTS provides only a generic error message without specific guidance for failure recovery. | "If there is a failure in payment processing (e.g., network failure, invalid payment method), an error message is displayed on the vehicle’s interface with instructions for resolution (e.g., manual payment via a mobile app or parking meter)." |
| UC specifies manual override options for failed payment or connectivity issues, which is not clearly defined in the SSTS. | "The system provides alternative instructions, such as prompting the user to manually complete the payment through a mobile app or a physical parking meter." |
| SSTS does not clarify the fallback method for receipt delivery in case of delivery failure, unlike the UC's requirement. | "A digital receipt is generated and sent to the user’s registered email or mobile device." |
| UC requires automatic parking area detection with full sensor compatibility, while SSTS lacks detailed explanation on how parking areas are detected. | "The system detects the vehicle’s presence in the parking facility and establishes a secure communication link with the facility’s payment infrastructure." |
| SSTS does not explicitly state how the system handles unregistered or unsupported payment methods, while the UC emphasizes this as a key feature. | "The vehicle’s payment system must be configured to securely store and process the user’s payment method (e.g., credit card, mobile wallet)." |
| UC requires a detailed exit protocol in the event of unsuccessful payment, which is more ambiguous in the SSTS. | "If payment is successfully processed but the user cannot exit the parking facility, the system logs the issue and prompts the user to contact support for assistance." |
| SSTS does not mention specific network recovery measures for payment processing failures, which is a requirement in the UC. | "The vehicle has a stable communication link to the internet or necessary network for interaction with the parking payment system." |
