| The UC specifies that the user must provide the battery level and desired charge, but the SSTS assumes the system will detect the battery level automatically. | "The user must provide battery level and desired charge." (UC) <br> "The system assumes vehicle auto-detection of battery level." (SSTS) |
| The UC requires handling of unavailable charging stations by notifying the user, while the SSTS does not explicitly mention this. | "If no charging stations are available, notify user." (UC) <br> "The system verifies the availability of charging stations based on the user’s current location and preferences." (SSTS) |
| The UC requires location-based charging station suggestions, but the SSTS does not explicitly mention location detection systems. | "Users are given location-based charging station options." (UC) <br> "A list of nearby, available charging stations is displayed." (SSTS) |
| The UC specifies that stations must be operational at the moment of the request, while the SSTS allows for temporary unavailability due to issues or maintenance. | "Charging stations must be operational and connected to the network." (UC) <br> "The charging station becomes unavailable during the session due to technical issues or maintenance, and the system halts the charging." (SSTS) |
| The UC explicitly requires user confirmation before the charging request is submitted, while the SSTS states the system automatically proceeds after the user selects a station. | "User confirms the charging request before proceeding." (UC) <br> "The user selects a charging station, and the system connects the vehicle to the chosen station, initiating the charging process." (SSTS) |
| The UC emphasizes that the system must send the user notifications about the charge status, while the SSTS only mentions session completion without detailing progress updates. | "System confirms charging completion with time and amount." (UC) <br> "The system communicates the expected time of completion and continuously tracks the charging progress." (SSTS) |
