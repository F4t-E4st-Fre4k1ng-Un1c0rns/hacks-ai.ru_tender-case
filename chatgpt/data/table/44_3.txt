| SSTS does not explicitly mention the feature is enabled by default in all vehicles, as required in the UC. | "The Automatic System Reset functionality is enabled by default in all vehicles equipped with the required in-car technology systems..." |
| SSTS does not specify that all user preferences will be restored after the reset, as per UC requirements. | "If the reset is successful, the in-car tech system will return to a fully functional state without requiring user intervention. If user data (preferences, settings) cannot be restored, the system will revert to default settings." |
| UC states the system should be able to detect all forms of malfunction (including minor glitches), but SSTS limits the detection to more significant failures. | "The system will detect a malfunction or unresponsiveness in any connected in-car technology components, such as infotainment, navigation, or digital control systems." |
| UC requires seamless recovery from all failures, but SSTS mentions possible exit into recovery mode, indicating potential for incomplete restoration. | "The system may enter a recovery mode if the failure persists, and in such cases, full functionality may not be restored until professional intervention occurs." |
| SSTS mentions that it does not detect hardware failures, whereas UC assumes detection of all failure types, including hardware-related issues. | "The system may not trigger on non-software related issues (e.g., hardware malfunctions, power failures, or severe software corruption)." |
| SSTS does not specify that user will be notified if the reset fails or if the system is unable to restore functionality, unlike UC's clear error messaging requirement. | "If the reset is unsuccessful, the system will prompt the user with an error message and suggest contacting customer support or visiting a service center for further diagnosis." |
