|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC mentions the ability to monitor the vehicle's security status from within the home via any smart device, but SSTS only states "real-time monitoring of the vehicle’s security system via the home automation interface." | "Provides the user with real-time monitoring of the vehicle’s security system via the home automation interface, including access to camera feeds if supported." |
| UC states "Energy Efficiency Management" should adjust home settings based on the vehicle's location when parked and secured, but SSTS only mentions energy adjustments triggered when the vehicle is parked and secured without clear linkage to location. | "Adjusts home settings such as lighting or temperature based on the vehicle’s security status, e.g., reducing energy consumption when the vehicle is parked and security is armed." |
| UC mentions vehicle alarm synchronization with home security in response to detected intrusions, but SSTS does not explicitly describe what happens when a breach occurs (e.g., home alarm sound). | "Enables synchronization of the vehicle’s alarm system with the home security system, ensuring both systems respond simultaneously to security threats." |
| UC requires "Remote Viewing" of the vehicle’s security camera feed, but SSTS only says that viewing is "available if supported," leaving the feature conditional. | "Provides the user with real-time monitoring of the vehicle’s security system via the home automation interface, including access to camera feeds if supported." |
| UC explicitly requires both systems (vehicle and home security) to "trigger home alarms" in the case of an intrusion, but SSTS only confirms synchronization of alarms without clearly detailing both systems triggering alarms. | "Enables synchronization of the vehicle’s alarm system with the home security system, ensuring both systems respond simultaneously to security threats." |
| SSTS does not include any mention of the specific platforms or integrations for home automation beyond generic references. The UC specifies "Amazon Alexa, Google Home," explicitly. | "The user must have an active home automation system, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or other compatible platforms that can support vehicle integration." |
