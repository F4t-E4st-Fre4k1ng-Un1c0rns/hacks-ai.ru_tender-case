| SSTS lacks a specified response time or latency requirement for detecting and alerting the driver, which is mentioned as an implicit need in the UC. | "The system generates the following outputs: A visual representation of the detected traffic sign, displayed on the vehicle’s dashboard or heads-up display." |
| The UC specifies that alerts should continue until all detected signs are cleared, but SSTS mentions deactivating the system if no new signs are detected for a period, which could lead to premature deactivation. | "The system exits alert mode once the driver acknowledges the information provided (e.g., adjusting speed based on the detected sign)." |
| SSTS does not clearly define the minimum road sign recognition accuracy or calibration standards, whereas the UC implies that the system should have precise and reliable sign detection. | "The system is compatible with the latest firmware and software updates, which should be installed to ensure optimal performance." |
| SSTS does not explicitly mention the mandatory auditory alert for all detected signs, whereas the UC requires both visual and auditory alerts for all signs. | "An auditory alert (optional): A clear, attention-grabbing sound (e.g., a beep or spoken announcement) for critical signs such as speed limits, stop signs, or yield signs." |
| The UC implies that the system should provide continuous alerts until signs are fully cleared, but SSTS states the system reverts to idle after a period of no new sign detection. | "The system exits alert mode once the driver has acknowledged the information (e.g., adjusting speed based on the detected sign)." |
| SSTS does not mention the system’s behavior when facing environmental interference, such as dirt on sensors, whereas the UC suggests that such conditions should trigger an alert. | "The system will deactivate or temporarily suspend operation in case of sensor or hardware malfunction, environmental interference (e.g., heavy rain or fog), or when road signs are no longer detectable." |
