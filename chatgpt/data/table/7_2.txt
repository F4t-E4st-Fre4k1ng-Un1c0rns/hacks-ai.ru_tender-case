| The SSTS does not explicitly mention hazard detection for road signs and environmental conditions, while the UC requires this. | "The system focuses on detecting obstacles, pedestrians, and other vehicles, but does not explicitly include road signs or environmental factors such as weather conditions." |
| The SSTS mentions the system is triggered only when the vehicle reaches a certain speed threshold, which is not fully compliant with the UC's requirement for early hazard detection at lower speeds. | "The system becomes active once the vehicle exceeds a specified minimum speed (e.g., 5 mph or higher)." |
| The SSTS does not clarify that the system should continuously monitor hazards even after the driver has taken corrective action, which is mentioned in the UC. | "The system will deactivate hazard alerts once the hazard is no longer a threat or has been avoided, such as when the vehicle passes the hazard or the object moves out of the detected range." |
| The SSTS lacks specific guidance on automatic calibration for changing environmental conditions, which is required by the UC. | "Proper calibration of sensors and system parameters is necessary to ensure accurate hazard detection under varying environmental conditions." |
| The SSTS does not fully detail the type of actionable feedback (e.g., braking or steering advice) provided to the driver, which is mentioned in the UC. | "The system may provide additional feedback, such as advising the driver to slow down, steer away, or apply brakes depending on the severity of the detected hazard." |
