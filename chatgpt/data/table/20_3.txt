| SSTS does not fully integrate health-related alerts, which are mentioned in the UC. | "The system triggers when an emergency event is detected by the onboard sensors, such as: A collision or sudden deceleration, Significant tire pressure changes, Activation of airbags or other safety mechanisms, A vehicle fault that triggers an immediate safety concern." |
| SSTS does not specify handling prolonged unresolved alerts as required by the UC. | "The alert remains on the dashboard until the driver takes action or the emergency is resolved. If the emergency condition persists, the system may continue to show the alert or provide instructions for manual intervention." |
| SSTS limits external connectivity for emergency alerts, while UC assumes a broader scope of external integration. | "An active vehicle network connection is required for external emergency alert functionality (e.g., communication with emergency services or connected devices)." |
| The system's response to a system failure is less detailed in the SSTS compared to the UC’s description. | "If the system detects a failure in the alert mechanism (e.g., sensor malfunction), it will display a failure notification on the dashboard, indicating that the emergency alert system is temporarily disabled." |
| SSTS mentions a failure notification when connectivity is lost but does not address the fallback mechanisms suggested in UC. | "If the system is connected to external services, a notification may be sent to emergency responders or a mobile app, depending on the configuration." |
