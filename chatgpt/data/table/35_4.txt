| The UC specifies that the system should be personalized for each driver, but the SSTS only mentions general system calibration without addressing driver-specific adjustments. | "The system is calibrated individually for each driver, including facial recognition and eye movement patterns to ensure accurate detection of fatigue signals." |
| The UC requires the system to issue alerts when fatigue is detected and continuously adjust based on historical data, while the SSTS does not mention adjusting alert thresholds based on historical fatigue patterns. | "The system continuously evaluates the driver's condition throughout the journey and can adjust alert thresholds based on real-time data and historical fatigue patterns." |
| UC specifies that the system should react to both fatigue and driver’s physical condition (e.g., head nodding), but the SSTS lacks clear detail on head nodding or specific facial expression triggers beyond eye-tracking and steering. | "Detection of facial expressions commonly associated with fatigue, including yawning, head nodding, or sluggish facial movements." |
| The UC emphasizes that low-light conditions can impair detection and require a fallback or clear error messaging, but the SSTS only mentions a generic sensor issue message. | "In case of sensor failure or environmental factors (e.g., low lighting), the system will display an error message (e.g., 'Fatigue Detection Unavailable – Adjust Lighting') but will continue to function with reduced capability or switch to a backup alert mode." |
| UC indicates the system must be able to handle a complete failure of facial recognition or eye-tracking, but the SSTS does not clearly address a comprehensive fallback system for these scenarios. | "The system will display an error message (e.g., 'Fatigue Detection Unavailable – Adjust Lighting') but will continue to function with reduced capability or switch to a backup alert mode." |
| UC specifies that a driver should receive continuous feedback if drowsiness is detected over a prolonged period, whereas the SSTS only mentions periodic alerts. | "If fatigue persists or worsens, the system may continue to issue periodic alerts or escalate the warning." |
