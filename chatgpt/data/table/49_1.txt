| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| The UC requires "immediate notifications" to the user when unauthorized movement is detected, whereas SSTS specifies "the system will send an immediate notification to the user" but does not explicitly emphasize immediacy as required. | "When theft detection is activated, and unauthorized movement is detected, the system will send an immediate notification to the user..." |
| UC emphasizes the vehicle’s movement history being available to the user for review, but SSTS does not specify this feature clearly as an essential part of the system. | "The vehicle’s movement history is logged and accessible to the user within the mobile app, showing any events of unauthorized movement or security breaches." |
| UC mentions vehicle tracking in “real-time,” but SSTS only says "displays the real-time location," without mentioning continuous tracking or updates as explicitly as the UC. | "The sub-System displays the real-time location of the vehicle on a map in the mobile application." |
| The UC implies that the system must be able to handle signal interruptions gracefully, but SSTS only mentions retry requests without detailing how it should handle prolonged failures or signal loss recovery. | "If there is a failure in communication (e.g., loss of GPS signal or cellular connection), the system will notify the user of the issue and request a retry." |
| UC mentions "manual deactivation" of tracking, but SSTS does not emphasize that tracking is manually deactivated by the user through the app in all cases. | "The system will exit location tracking mode once the user manually deactivates the feature through the mobile application." |
| UC requires the vehicle to return to a secure state to stop theft alerts, but SSTS does not specify exactly how the system determines that the vehicle has returned to a "secure state" in the case of a security breach. | "The theft detection feature will stop alerting once the system confirms that the vehicle has returned to a secure state, either through authorized movement or by user verification." |
