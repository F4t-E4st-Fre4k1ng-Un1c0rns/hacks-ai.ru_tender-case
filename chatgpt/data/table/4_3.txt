| The UC assumes a fully functional system, while the SSTS acknowledges partial compliance and possible limitations. | "While the system is partially compliant, some features may not be fully optimized, and certain conditions may result in degraded performance or limited functionality." |
| UC presents an ideal user experience without errors, but SSTS describes error handling and alternative interactions due to partial compliance. | "If the system recognizes an issue with loading or applying the profile, an error message is generated, prompting the user to attempt re-authentication or manual adjustments." |
| UC emphasizes seamless user interaction, while SSTS includes details on malfunctioning conditions (e.g., failure to recognize user profiles). | "The system detects a user profile mismatch or failure to recognize the user, initiating an error message and prompting the user to authenticate again." |
| UC assumes no reduced functionality, while SSTS includes warnings for potential feature unavailability and degraded performance. | "If partial functionality is detected (e.g., voice command failure, connectivity issues), the system notifies the user and offers alternative methods for interaction (e.g., touch interface)." |
| UC implies the system works flawlessly, but SSTS mentions specific conditions that may cause certain features not to function. | "Due to partial compliance, some features may not be fully optimized, and certain interactions may not function as smoothly as expected across all vehicle models or operating system versions." |
| UC focuses on user interaction without mentioning the need for system retries, while SSTS describes retries when issues occur. | "The system will attempt to restore functionality but may prompt the user to use alternative interfaces or retry at a later time." |
