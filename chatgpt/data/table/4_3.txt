| UC mentions full customization of navigation preferences, but the SSTS only refers to music and climate preferences. | "The User Preferences Management for Infotainment System allows users to customize and store their personal preferences related to the infotainment features, such as audio settings, climate control, seat position, and navigation configurations." |
| UC assumes full profile synchronization across devices, while SSTS only mentions internet connectivity without addressing potential synchronization failures. | "The system must be connected to the internet for synchronization of preferences across multiple devices (if applicable)." |
| UC assumes that preferences are automatically recalled without failure, while SSTS provides a fallback mechanism but lacks full clarity on failure cases. | "In case of system errors, a fallback mechanism should be in place to ensure the system continues to function as intended." |
| UC defines a clear, detailed user journey for interacting with the system, but the SSTS lacks full coverage of possible input devices and hardware variations. | "The system must be configured to allow preference settings to be stored and retrieved from the user’s profile." |
| UC expects the system to recall preferences every time the user enters the vehicle, but the SSTS does not fully clarify handling of failure scenarios when preferences cannot be recalled. | "If there is an error (e.g., network failure), the system will prompt the user to try again later but still allow basic functionalities such as manual adjustments." |
