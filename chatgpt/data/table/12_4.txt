| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC requires confirmation of successful customization after each change, while SSTS does not consistently confirm successful changes. | "The system fails to confirm successful customization with clear feedback or confirmation prompts." |
| UC specifies that changes should be applied immediately after selection, but SSTS requires a reboot for changes to take effect. | "When a change is made, the voice assistant continues to operate with its default settings until the vehicle is restarted, meaning the user’s selection is not applied until a system reboot." |
| UC includes a profile authentication requirement to access customization, while SSTS does not properly enforce this requirement. | "The 'Personalized profile' requirement is not properly enforced, allowing a non-authenticated user to access customization settings." |
| UC provides clear triggers for customization, but SSTS mentions issues with recognizing specific commands such as "Change assistant voice." | "The 'Change assistant voice' command is not recognized as a valid input by the system, leading to no response when trying to trigger customization." |
| UC specifies that the system must provide a notification if changes are not saved, while SSTS does not include this feature. | "There is no mechanism in place to notify the user if changes are not successfully applied, leaving them unaware of any issues." |
| UC requires a smooth and consistent user experience with customization, but SSTS describes inconsistencies where changes may not be applied correctly. | "After exiting, the system occasionally fails to apply changes, especially when multiple settings (voice, tone, style) are adjusted simultaneously." |
| UC outlines that the system should provide error messages or recovery options when customization fails, but SSTS lacks these recovery mechanisms. | "There is no clear error message or recovery option when customization fails, leaving the user uncertain about how to proceed." |
