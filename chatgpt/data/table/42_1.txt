|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC expects proactive mitigation actions, such as automatic steering adjustments or braking, while SSTS only mentions alerts and warnings. | "If necessary, the system may also trigger emergency safety responses, including pre-emptive braking or lane departure warnings to mitigate potential accidents." |
| UC specifies personalized response to driver attention based on individual habits, but SSTS lacks mention of any adaptive behavior based on driver preferences or patterns. | "The system will exit the distraction detection mode when the driver refocuses on the road, as indicated by changes in eye-tracking or head position that meet predefined attention criteria." |
| UC outlines the system should handle malfunctions with detailed alternative scenarios, but SSTS only briefly mentions error logging without in-depth failure handling scenarios. | "If the system encounters a malfunction (e.g., failure of the cameras, sensors, or software), it will log the error and notify the driver through the infotainment display that monitoring is temporarily unavailable." |
| UC includes more comprehensive environmental data integration (e.g., road conditions), but SSTS does not include such environmental triggers beyond distraction detection. | "The system will continuously evaluate driver focus and attention while the vehicle is in motion." |
| UC requires a response when the system detects severe distraction, including intervention measures like reducing vehicle speed, which SSTS only vaguely touches on. | "If necessary, the system may also trigger emergency safety responses, including pre-emptive braking or lane departure warnings to mitigate potential accidents." |
| SSTS lacks a clear distinction of different types of distractions (e.g., visual, auditory, cognitive) based on UC’s expectations. | "Upon detection of driver distraction, the system will initiate a progressive series of alerts..." |
| UC emphasizes clear logs and ongoing system improvement, while SSTS lacks specific mechanisms for feedback data collection and system updates based on driver performance. | "The system will exit if the driver deactivates the feature through the vehicle's settings menu." |
