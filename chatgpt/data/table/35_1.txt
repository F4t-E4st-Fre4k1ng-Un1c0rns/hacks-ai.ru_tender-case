| SSTS specifies that the system must be manually activated, whereas the UC requires automatic activation upon vehicle startup. | "The system must be activated and set up through the vehicle's settings interface. The driver must enable the system before driving." |
| SSTS does not mention that fatigue alerts should specifically advise the driver to "take a break" or "refresh" as per the UC. | "A message is displayed on the dashboard (e.g., 'Please take a break') along with a warning icon." |
| SSTS does not specify that the system logs each fatigue incident for future analysis, a requirement stated in the UC. | "The system logs each incident of detected fatigue, including the time and the frequency of alerts, which can be accessed for review through the vehicle's diagnostic tools." |
| UC specifies that the system automatically resumes monitoring after an alert, while the SSTS indicates that the system resumes only after the driver acknowledges the alert. | "The system resets and returns to normal monitoring once the driver acknowledges the alert." |
| SSTS does not mention that an alternative or fallback option should be available in case of system failure, unlike the UC which notes temporary disablement. | "In the case of a malfunction (e.g., sensor failure or connectivity issues), the system will disable the fatigue detection feature and notify the driver through a warning message on the dashboard." |
| SSTS does not clearly specify that a manual alert mechanism should be in place if the system fails or is unavailable, which the UC implies for safety. | "The driver is instructed to address the issue via the vehicle’s diagnostic tools or by contacting customer support." |
