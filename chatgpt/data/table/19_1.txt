| **Differences** | **Quotation** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC requires the system to provide **automatic real-time alerts** for detected issues, whereas SSTS only allows user-initiated checks or periodic reports. | "The system will detect if any critical system failures occur (e.g., low battery, overheating) and automatically generate an alert to the user." |
| UC specifies **proactive scheduling** of maintenance based on detected issues, while SSTS only provides maintenance scheduling if manually triggered by the user. | "The user will have the option to schedule maintenance or service appointments directly via the app or in-vehicle system, with integrated calendar management." |
| UC mentions **automatic generation of reports** on every vehicle start and real-time feedback, whereas SSTS only mentions scheduled checks or user-triggered reports. | "The system is triggered automatically upon vehicle startup, or when any monitored parameter (battery level, tire pressure, temperature) deviates from predefined safe operating thresholds." |
| UC specifies **comprehensive maintenance recommendations** based on system diagnostics, but SSTS does not guarantee clear actionable recommendations for all issues. | "The report will include recommended actions or maintenance steps for any identified issues, such as 'Check tire pressure,' 'Schedule battery service,' or 'Monitor engine temperature.'" |
| UC emphasizes **continuous real-time monitoring** of vehicle health, while SSTS mentions only periodic checks or manual triggering of reports. | "Scheduled periodic health checks may be triggered based on configurable time intervals (e.g., monthly or every 500 miles), ensuring routine diagnostics." |
| UC requires **historical report storage** with easy access, while SSTS is unclear about the long-term availability of reports. | "All generated reports are stored securely in the cloud, allowing users to access historical data at any time through the app or vehicle system." |
| UC mentions the system will **automatically suggest actions** in case of an issue, but SSTS does not clearly ensure that the system always provides proactive suggestions. | "If a critical issue is detected, such as a low battery or overheating motor, the system will issue an alert to the user in real time, and provide actionable suggestions (e.g., 'Please visit a service center immediately')." |
| UC requires **immediate real-time actions** based on detected failures, but SSTS only provides alerts and recommendations without automatic interventions. | "The system will detect if any critical system failures occur (e.g., low battery, overheating) and automatically generate an alert to the user." |
| UC includes **error handling and troubleshooting guidance** in case of sensor or system failures, whereas SSTS only mentions errors without providing specific troubleshooting steps. | "If the system encounters an issue, such as a sensor failure or lack of connectivity, it will provide the user with an error message, recommend troubleshooting steps, or offer an option to contact customer support." |
