|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UC specifies that the system should provide *real-time monitoring*, but SSTS only mentions monitoring based on triggered events or scheduled intervals, implying the system may not offer continuous monitoring. | "The system triggers diagnostics when a fault or irregularity is detected or at pre-scheduled intervals." |
| UC requires the system to allow for *user-initiated diagnostics* at any time, but SSTS mentions that diagnostics are primarily triggered by system faults or scheduled intervals, with less emphasis on user flexibility. | "The system triggers diagnostics based on fault detection or at pre-scheduled intervals." |
| UC mentions the system should generate *fully automated* reports without requiring user intervention, but SSTS does not clarify that reports are fully automated for all conditions, possibly requiring manual triggers. | "The vehicle's system is connected to the cloud for real-time data processing and report generation." |
| UC specifies the system should offer *detailed actionable insights* in reports (including suggestions for nearby service centers), but SSTS mentions general recommendations without specifying detailed guidance on service centers or actions. | "The report includes any issues found, their severity (e.g., critical, moderate, or minor), and recommended actions (e.g., repair, replacement, or monitoring)." |
| UC specifies that the system should *automatically schedule follow-up diagnostics* or provide reminders based on severity, but SSTS only mentions logging the diagnostic results without clear follow-up actions. | "The system logs the diagnostic results in the vehicle's maintenance history, including any actions taken or needed." |
| UC specifies that the system should deliver reports in *multiple formats* (e.g., app, email, SMS), but SSTS mentions only these mediums without addressing the flexibility of formats or frequency of notifications. | "The report is automatically delivered to the user via their chosen notification method (app, email, SMS)." |
| UC requires *continuous data collection* for real-time monitoring, but SSTS does not explicitly state this; it only mentions the vehicle's system being capable of sending data when diagnostics are triggered. | "The vehicle’s system is connected to the cloud for real-time data processing and report generation." |
