**Title**  
Real-Time Vehicle Location and Theft Detection  

**Goal**  
The Real-Time Vehicle Location and Theft Detection sub-system provides the user with accurate and immediate tracking of the vehicle’s location, helping detect any unauthorized movement or potential theft in real-time. This system ensures that the user is immediately alerted to any suspicious activity, while providing the ability to track the vehicle’s exact position via a mobile application or website.

**Preconditions**  
- The sub-system is installed and properly integrated into the vehicle at the time of purchase.
- The user must have a registered account in the mobile app or on the vehicle's connected portal.
- The vehicle’s GPS and communication modules must be active and functioning correctly.
- The user’s mobile device or computer must have an active internet connection to receive real-time notifications.

**Main Scenario**  
1. Bob logs into the mobile app connected to his vehicle’s system.
2. Bob opens the "Vehicle Location" section of the app to view the current location of his car.
3. The sub-system uses GPS to display the real-time location of the vehicle on a map.
4. If the vehicle is moved without authorization, an immediate alert is sent to Bob’s phone, notifying him of potential theft.
5. Bob can view detailed location data, including time and route, on the app and can decide to contact authorities or take other action.

**Alternative Scenario**  
1. Bob attempts to access the vehicle's location via the app but the GPS signal is temporarily lost.
2. The sub-system responds by showing a "Signal Lost" message and attempts to re-establish connection.
3. If the system remains unable to connect, Bob is advised via an in-app notification to check the vehicle’s connectivity or contact customer support.
4. In case of a technical failure, Bob can still receive an SMS or email notification with the last known location and status of the vehicle.
5. Bob is given an option to retry tracking later, or to engage manual security features like remote engine disablement.

**Postconditions**  
- Upon successful interaction, Bob is provided with an accurate real-time location of the vehicle, and if a theft is detected, the system records the event and provides immediate alerts for further action.
- The vehicle's security status is updated, and all relevant location data is logged for future reference.
- If necessary, authorities are notified and provided with real-time location information to aid in the recovery of the vehicle.
