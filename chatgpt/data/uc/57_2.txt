**Underpinning Contract: Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System**

**Goal**  
The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System (EEES) is designed to provide a seamless and efficient evacuation process in case of emergencies within the vehicle. The system ensures that passengers can safely exit the luxury electric car in a variety of emergency situations by deploying automated features such as door unlocking, emergency window opening, and the activation of safety signals. Additionally, the system aims to prioritize the safety and well-being of all occupants while minimizing potential risks during evacuations.

**Preconditions**  
- The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System is integrated into the vehicle’s central control system and is active during all operational phases (e.g., ignition, driving, or stationary).
- The system must be calibrated with the vehicle's safety sensors to detect hazardous conditions, including fires, accidents, or other emergency events.
- All passengers must be seated with their seat belts fastened during regular use to ensure the system can accurately detect and respond to emergency scenarios.
- The system requires a stable power source and may rely on backup battery reserves in the event of vehicle power failure.

**Main Scenario**  
1. **Step 1**: In the event of an emergency, such as a collision or fire, the system automatically detects the hazard through integrated sensors and environmental data.
   - *Response*: The EEES activates, unlocking the doors and retracting any safety barriers to enable immediate passenger evacuation.
  
2. **Step 2**: The system sends a visual and auditory alert to all passengers indicating that evacuation is necessary.  
   - *Response*: Lights flash and an emergency evacuation sound plays, guiding passengers towards the nearest exit.
  
3. **Step 3**: Passengers, such as Alise, receive a clear prompt on the vehicle’s display to begin evacuation.  
   - *Response*: The system confirms Alise's action, ensuring that all doors or windows are unobstructed for a smooth exit.
  
4. **Step 4**: Alise presses a designated emergency evacuation button located within reach.  
   - *Response*: The system verifies the action and opens the door or deploys windows, making the escape route accessible.

5. **Step 5**: Alise safely exits the vehicle, and the system continues to monitor for other passengers, ensuring all are evacuated and safe.  
   - *Response*: The EEES confirms the successful evacuation and sends real-time data to emergency services for further assistance.

**Alternative Scenario**  
1. **Step 1**: A malfunction occurs, and the system fails to automatically detect the emergency hazard, such as in the case of Bob being unconscious or unresponsive.  
   - *Response*: The system issues a manual prompt via the display or audio signals, urging Bob to manually activate the evacuation feature.

2. **Step 2**: Bob presses the manual evacuation button.  
   - *Response*: If the automatic features are disabled, the system relies on backup functionality to unlock the doors or deploy emergency windows via manual control.

3. **Step 3**: Bob’s seatbelt fails to release, preventing easy movement.  
   - *Response*: The system automatically signals the seatbelt release mechanism, or alternatively, the seatbelt is unlocked through a manual override.

4. **Step 4**: Bob, in a state of confusion, struggles to open the door.  
   - *Response*: The system activates additional safety mechanisms, such as a secondary emergency exit window, allowing Bob to exit without difficulty.

5. **Step 5**: Bob successfully exits the vehicle and moves to safety.  
   - *Response*: The EEES monitors the status of the vehicle and sends an alert to emergency responders about Bob’s location.

**Postconditions**  
- After the evacuation is successfully carried out, the system logs the event, including the number of people evacuated, the time taken, and any critical incidents that occurred during the process.
- All vehicle doors and windows are restored to a safe, locked position after evacuation is complete to prevent any unauthorized access.
- The vehicle is placed into an alert status, notifying emergency services of the successful evacuation and the need for potential follow-up actions.
- The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System is reset, ready to assist in future emergency events.
