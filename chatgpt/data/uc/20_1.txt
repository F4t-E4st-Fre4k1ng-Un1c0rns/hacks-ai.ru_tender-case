**Underpinning Contract for Sub-System: Integrating Emergency Alerts in Vehicle Dashboard**

**1. Title**  
Integrating Emergency Alerts in Vehicle Dashboard

**2. Goal**  
The Integrating Emergency Alerts in Vehicle Dashboard sub-system will provide real-time emergency alert notifications to the vehicle driver, ensuring they are informed of potential hazards, accidents, or critical system warnings. The alerts will be displayed in a clear and concise manner on the vehicle’s dashboard, enabling the driver to take timely and appropriate actions to ensure safety.

**3. Preconditions**  
- The vehicle is powered on and fully functional.  
- The vehicle’s dashboard system is operational and can display notifications.  
- The emergency alert system is integrated into the vehicle's onboard software and has access to real-time data feeds (e.g., GPS, sensors, traffic data).  
- The driver has the ability to acknowledge or dismiss alerts via the dashboard interface.  
- The emergency alert system is configured with relevant thresholds for different types of emergencies (e.g., collision, mechanical failure, weather hazards).

**4. Main Scenario**  
1. The vehicle’s sensors detect an emergency situation (e.g., sudden braking, obstacle detection, or critical mechanical failure).  
2. The sub-system processes the data and triggers the appropriate emergency alert on the vehicle’s dashboard.  
3. The alert appears as a visual notification, accompanied by an audible sound (if enabled). For example, a red flashing icon and text such as “Collision Warning Ahead”.  
4. The driver, Bob, receives the notification and can either acknowledge the alert by pressing a “Dismiss” button or take action according to the situation.  
5. If the alert is acknowledged or resolved, the alert disappears from the dashboard, and the system logs the event for future reference.  

**5. Alternative Scenario**  
1. The vehicle detects an emergency situation, but the emergency alert system is temporarily unavailable (e.g., system error or malfunction).  
2. Bob receives no immediate alert on the dashboard, but the vehicle’s backup system (e.g., audible alarm, external lights) will activate to alert the driver.  
3. A secondary notification, indicating the alert system is unavailable, will appear on the dashboard. Bob is instructed to take manual action and may contact support.  
4. The vehicle logs the error and attempts to restore the alert system once conditions allow (e.g., after restarting the vehicle or system recovery).  
5. Bob acknowledges the notification that the alert system is down and continues driving cautiously while awaiting system restoration.

**6. Postconditions**  
- Upon successful interaction with the emergency alert, the driver has been informed about a potential hazard or system failure.  
- If the alert was acknowledged or resolved, the system resets and no longer displays the alert unless the emergency condition recurs.  
- The system logs the alert details, including the type, time, and resolution status, for diagnostic and improvement purposes.
