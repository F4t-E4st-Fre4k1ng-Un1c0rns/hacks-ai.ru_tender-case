**Underpinning Contract: Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization**

1. **Goal**
   The Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization allows the user to personalize and adjust various parameters of the vehicle's adaptive cruise control system. This includes setting preferred speed limits, adjusting following distance, and choosing from various driving modes (e.g., relaxed, standard, or aggressive). The goal is to provide a tailored driving experience that enhances both comfort and safety, offering full control over the system’s responsiveness to road conditions and traffic patterns.

2. **Preconditions**
   - The vehicle is powered on and the engine is running.
   - The Adaptive Cruise Control system is enabled through the vehicle’s infotainment or dashboard interface.
   - The vehicle is on a road with a clear lane and suitable conditions for the system to operate (e.g., minimal traffic, no inclement weather).
   - The user has access to the customization options through the vehicle’s settings menu.
   - The system must be in good working condition, with no error messages or malfunctions present.

3. **Main Scenario**
   1. **User** (e.g., Alise) accesses the Adaptive Cruise Control customization menu through the vehicle’s touchscreen interface.
   2. The system displays a list of customization options, such as speed limits, following distance, and driving modes.
   3. **User** selects their desired driving mode (e.g., “Standard”) and adjusts the following distance to a preferred setting (e.g., "3 seconds").
   4. The system confirms the changes with a notification ("Settings saved successfully").
   5. **User** exits the customization menu and engages the adaptive cruise control system, which now operates according to the user’s preferences.

4. **Alternative Scenario**
   1. **User** (e.g., Bob) attempts to access the Adaptive Cruise Control customization menu but the system is currently unavailable (e.g., due to a system error or environmental conditions).
   2. The system displays an error message or an alert indicating the unavailability of the customization feature (“Adaptive Cruise Control customization not available at this time”).
   3. **User** is prompted to check the vehicle’s status (e.g., whether adaptive cruise control is enabled, or if there are any issues with the vehicle’s sensors).
   4. The user is provided with troubleshooting tips or directed to a service center if the issue persists.
   5. If the issue is resolved, the user may attempt to access the customization menu again once the system is functional.

5. **Postconditions**
   After a successful interaction with the Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization, the vehicle’s adaptive cruise control operates with the user-defined settings. This includes the newly selected speed limit, adjusted following distance, and the chosen driving mode. The system responds to road conditions and traffic patterns in a way that aligns with the user’s preferences, enhancing both comfort and safety during driving.
