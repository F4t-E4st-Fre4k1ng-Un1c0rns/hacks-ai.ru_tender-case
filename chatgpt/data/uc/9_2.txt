**Underpinning Contract: Vehicle Data Analytics for Fleet Management**

**1. Title:**
Vehicle Data Analytics for Fleet Management

**2. Goal:**
The Vehicle Data Analytics for Fleet Management sub-system is designed to provide advanced insights and real-time analytics to help manage and optimize the performance of a fleet of luxury electric cars. This system will track key performance indicators (KPIs), including battery life, vehicle health, location data, maintenance needs, and driving behavior. The goal is to enable fleet managers to make informed decisions, improve operational efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance the overall user experience for both drivers and management.

**3. Preconditions:**
- The system is connected to the fleet's vehicles and has access to the data streams from each vehicle.
- The user (fleet manager) has valid credentials and access to the sub-system interface.
- Data collection for each vehicle is active and functioning correctly, including GPS, telemetry, and diagnostic data.
- The fleet manager has access to necessary devices (such as computers, mobile devices) to interact with the system.
- The system is integrated with existing fleet management tools or software used by the company.

**4. Main Scenario:**
1. **Login:** Bob, the fleet manager, logs into the Vehicle Data Analytics system using his credentials.
2. **Dashboard Overview:** Once logged in, Bob is presented with a dashboard displaying key metrics for each vehicle in the fleet, such as battery status, distance traveled, and maintenance alerts.
3. **Vehicle Selection:** Bob selects a specific vehicle from the dashboard to view detailed analytics, including vehicle health, driving behavior data, and maintenance recommendations.
4. **Data Analysis:** Bob reviews the analytics for the selected vehicle, including historical performance data and real-time alerts on any issues, such as low battery or scheduled maintenance.
5. **Actionable Insights:** Based on the analysis, Bob decides to schedule maintenance or modify the vehicle's usage pattern to optimize efficiency, either by adjusting routes or driving behavior. The system generates a report for this action.

**5. Alternative Scenario:**
1. **Login Failure:** Alise, the fleet manager, attempts to log in but encounters an error with her credentials.
2. **Error Notification:** The system notifies Alise that her credentials are incorrect and prompts her to retry or reset her password.
3. **System Downtime:** The system experiences an outage, and Alise cannot access the analytics. A notification is sent informing her that the system is temporarily unavailable and when it is expected to be back online.
4. **Data Syncing Failure:** The system fails to sync data from a vehicle. Alise is alerted with an error message and provided with troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue or escalate to technical support.
5. **Limited Functionality:** If the analytics are limited due to a lack of real-time data, the system provides a fallback display of historical data and allows for basic vehicle management tasks to continue.

**6. Postconditions:**
- After a successful interaction with the sub-system, Bob or Alise will have up-to-date analytics on each vehicle's performance, including alerts, maintenance status, and usage patterns.
- The system will have recorded any actions taken, such as maintenance scheduling or performance optimization recommendations.
- The fleet manager will be able to make data-driven decisions regarding fleet operations, reducing inefficiencies and improving vehicle longevity.
