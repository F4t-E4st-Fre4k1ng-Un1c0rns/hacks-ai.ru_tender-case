**Underpinning Contract for Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance)**

**1. Goal**  
The Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance) aims to provide drivers with a seamless and safe parking experience by automating the process of parking a vehicle. The system will assist in identifying available parking spaces, guiding the vehicle into the space, and performing maneuvers such as steering, braking, and acceleration. This feature ensures accurate parking, reduces the risk of collisions, and improves convenience for users.

**2. Preconditions**  
- The Driver-Assisted Parking System is available only on vehicles equipped with the required sensors, cameras, and software.  
- The vehicle must be in a parking area or near an available parking spot where the system can function properly.  
- The user must enable the system through the vehicle’s dashboard or voice command interface.  
- The user must ensure that there are no obstructions or barriers in the parking area that would prevent the system from operating effectively.  
- The system may not function in inclement weather conditions, extreme temperatures, or environments with heavy interference from other electronic devices.

**3. Main Scenario**  
1. Alise enters the parking lot and selects a parking space from the available options displayed on the vehicle’s screen.  
2. She activates the Driver-Assisted Parking System through the dashboard or voice command, signaling her intent to park the vehicle automatically.  
3. The system scans the area, detects available space, and begins guiding the car into the spot.  
4. The vehicle autonomously steers, accelerates, and brakes as necessary to park the car in the designated spot, while Alise monitors the process on the screen.  
5. Once the car is successfully parked, the system notifies Alise that the parking is complete, and she can safely exit the vehicle.

**4. Alternative Scenario**  
1. Bob enters a parking lot but finds that the parking spaces are too narrow for the system to perform automated parking.  
2. The Driver-Assisted Parking System alerts Bob that the space is not suitable for automatic parking and recommends manual parking instead.  
3. Bob can either park the vehicle manually or drive to a different area with wider parking spaces that the system can accommodate.  
4. If the system encounters an obstruction or malfunction, it will stop the parking process and provide a warning message.  
5. Bob is then advised to either clear the obstruction or deactivate the system and park manually.

**5. Postconditions**  
After the successful interaction with the Driver-Assisted Parking System, the vehicle will be parked within the designated space, with proper alignment and safety measures in place. The system will deactivate, and the user will be notified that the parking process is complete. The vehicle will be safely secured, and the user can exit the car without concern for misalignment or potential collisions.
