**Title:** Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System

**Goal:**  
The Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System (RTCAWS) is designed to enhance driving safety by providing continuous monitoring of the vehicle's surroundings. It will alert the driver in case of potential collisions and automatically assist in avoiding dangerous situations by initiating corrective actions, such as braking or steering adjustments, when necessary. This feature aims to reduce accidents and improve the overall safety of luxury electric vehicles.

**Preconditions:**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with sensors (radar, LIDAR, cameras, etc.) to detect nearby obstacles and other vehicles.  
- The system must be activated at the start of the driving session.  
- The driver must be seated and have hands on the wheel for the system to be fully functional.  
- The vehicle’s onboard computer must be operational and connected to the system’s real-time processing unit.

**Main Scenario:**  
1. Bob starts the vehicle and activates the Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System.  
2. As Bob drives, the system continuously monitors the surroundings using sensors and cameras.  
3. If a potential collision is detected (e.g., another car moving into the vehicle's path), the system warns Bob with an auditory or visual alert.  
4. If the risk of collision becomes imminent, the system automatically applies the brakes or adjusts the steering to avoid impact.  
5. Bob resumes control of the vehicle once the threat is mitigated, and the system returns to its monitoring mode.

**Alternative Scenario:**  
1. Bob starts the vehicle, but the system reports a malfunction (e.g., sensor failure).  
2. The vehicle displays a warning message on the dashboard, indicating that the Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System is not available.  
3. Bob continues driving without the system’s assistance, but the vehicle relies on traditional driver vigilance.  
4. In the event of an emergency, the vehicle may prompt Bob to visit the service center for system diagnosis and repair.  
5. The system will become operational again once the issue is resolved.

**Postconditions:**  
After successful interaction, the Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System will have provided the driver with real-time hazard alerts, and if necessary, autonomously mitigated collision risks by engaging corrective actions, ensuring enhanced vehicle safety. If the system was unable to function, the driver is informed, and safety precautions are recommended.
