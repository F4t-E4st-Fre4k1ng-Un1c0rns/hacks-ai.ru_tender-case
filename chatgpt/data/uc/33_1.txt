**Underpinning Contract: User Authentication and Authorization for Car Access**

**1. Goal**  
The User Authentication and Authorization for Car Access sub-system will allow authorized users (e.g., car owners, registered drivers) to securely access and operate the luxury electric car. This sub-system will manage the authentication process by verifying the user’s identity and authorize or deny access based on predefined permissions. The main capabilities of this sub-system include:  
- Secure login using biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) or personal identification (PIN).  
- Verification of user identity through multi-factor authentication, where applicable.  
- Authorization to control or unlock the vehicle's systems based on the user's role (e.g., owner, driver, guest).  
- Real-time user status update and monitoring of access rights.

**2. Preconditions**  
- The user must have a registered account in the system with an active authentication profile, such as fingerprint data, facial recognition, or a PIN.  
- The vehicle must be equipped with compatible hardware (e.g., fingerprint scanner, facial recognition camera) and connected to the central server or authentication system.  
- The user’s account must have appropriate permissions set by the car owner or administrator (e.g., owner can assign driving privileges to a guest).  
- The sub-system requires a secure internet connection for real-time authorization requests to be processed.

**3. Main Scenario**  
1. The user approaches the car and attempts to unlock it by interacting with the authentication system (e.g., placing a finger on the sensor, scanning face, or entering a PIN).  
2. The sub-system processes the user’s input, verifying the fingerprint, face, or PIN against the stored profile in the system.  
3. If the user is successfully authenticated, the sub-system checks the user's permissions to determine their authorization level (e.g., owner, driver, guest).  
4. Based on the results, the sub-system grants or denies access to the car’s systems (e.g., unlocking doors, starting the vehicle).  
5. The car’s systems respond accordingly, either allowing the user to drive or providing access to limited features depending on the authorization level.

**4. Alternative Scenario**  
1. The user attempts to authenticate using their fingerprint, facial recognition, or PIN.  
2. The sub-system fails to recognize the user's input due to poor biometric data quality (e.g., dirty sensor, poor lighting, etc.), or the PIN is incorrect.  
3. The sub-system prompts the user to retry the authentication, offering suggestions like cleaning the sensor, adjusting the position, or trying a different method (e.g., PIN instead of fingerprint).  
4. If the retry fails, the sub-system may prompt the user to reset their authentication data or contact the car’s support team for assistance.  
5. As an additional security measure, after a series of failed attempts, the sub-system may lock access for a specified period or require additional verification (e.g., multi-factor authentication) to prevent unauthorized access.

**5. Postconditions**  
- Upon successful authentication and authorization, the user gains access to the vehicle’s systems according to their permissions.  
- The vehicle’s locking system is disengaged, allowing the user to enter and operate the car.  
- The user’s status is updated to reflect their access rights (e.g., "authenticated and authorized" for car access).  
- Any failed login attempts are logged for security monitoring purposes.  
- If the user’s session ends or is interrupted (e.g., car is locked, user logs out), the system ensures the vehicle is properly secured again.
