**2. Goal**  
The Customizable Seat Position and Memory System provides users with the ability to adjust the seat position to their preferred settings and save those preferences for future use.

The main features of this system include:
- Ability to adjust seat position in terms of seat depth, height, tilt, and backrest angle.
- Storage of up to three different driver profiles, each with unique seat settings.
- Quick and easy retrieval of saved profiles via a memory button.
- Smooth and automatic seat adjustments to predefined positions with minimal user input.
