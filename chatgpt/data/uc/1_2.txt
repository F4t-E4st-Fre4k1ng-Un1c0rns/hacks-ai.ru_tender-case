**Title:**  
Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration Underpinning Contract

---

**Goal:**  
The Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication feature enables luxury electric car users to communicate with nearby vehicles in real-time. Through this system, vehicles will share essential information, such as speed, direction, and braking status, allowing for enhanced driver safety, reduced traffic congestion, and optimized route planning. This communication aims to improve the user's driving experience by providing situational awareness and anticipatory responses to road conditions and potential hazards.

---

**Preconditions:**  
- The vehicle's V2V Communication system is active and functioning.
- Nearby vehicles are equipped with compatible V2V systems.
- Communication is enabled via a secure, encrypted channel to protect data and ensure privacy.
- The system has adequate power and connection to onboard sensors and navigation systems.

**Main Scenario:**  
1. **User Action:** Alice activates the V2V Communication system from the car’s central control panel.  
   **System Response:** The system establishes a connection with other V2V-enabled vehicles within a 100-meter radius.

2. **User Action:** Alice begins driving, and the V2V system continuously collects and broadcasts the car’s speed and heading.  
   **System Response:** The system processes data from nearby vehicles and displays potential hazards on the dashboard.

3. **User Action:** Bob's vehicle ahead suddenly brakes due to an obstacle.  
   **System Response:** Alice's V2V system instantly receives a braking alert from Bob's vehicle, prompting a visual and audio warning.

4. **User Action:** Alice slows down in response to the alert.  
   **System Response:** The V2V system confirms Alice’s deceleration and communicates this change to nearby vehicles to maintain safe following distances.

5. **User Action:** Alice continues driving, with the V2V system constantly monitoring and updating information in real time.  
   **System Response:** The system remains active, dynamically adjusting alerts and optimizing routes as necessary based on data from nearby vehicles.

**Alternative Scenario:**  
- **User Action:** Alice activates the V2V Communication system, but the system encounters a connectivity error due to a network malfunction or interference.
  **System Response:** The system displays a notification on the dashboard, indicating that V2V communication is temporarily unavailable and suggesting that Alice rely on manual observation.

- **User Action:** While driving, Alice attempts to use V2V data for routing, but data transmission from other vehicles is limited due to low signal strength.
  **System Response:** The system defaults to using onboard sensors and GPS data until V2V communication is reestablished.

**Postconditions:**  
Upon successful interaction, the V2V Communication system provides Alice with increased situational awareness, allowing her to anticipate and respond to nearby vehicles' actions more effectively. This results in a safer and more informed driving experience, reducing the likelihood of accidents and improving traffic flow efficiency.
