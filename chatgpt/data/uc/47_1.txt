Wi-Fi Hotspot Management and Data Usage Monitoring

**Goal**  
The Wi-Fi Hotspot Management and Data Usage Monitoring subsystem will allow users to connect to the internet via the vehicle’s Wi-Fi hotspot, monitor their data usage, and manage connectivity settings for optimal usage. Users will be able to control the data limits, track consumption, and receive notifications when data thresholds are reached.

**Preconditions**  
- The vehicle must have an active internet connection via the in-built cellular module.  
- User must be in the vehicle and within range of the Wi-Fi hotspot.
- The vehicle’s Wi-Fi hotspot feature must be enabled in the system settings.  
- A valid mobile data plan should be associated with the vehicle.

**Main Scenario**  
1. User (Alise) accesses the car’s main infotainment screen and selects "Wi-Fi Hotspot" from the menu.  
2. The subsystem displays the current Wi-Fi hotspot status and data usage information.  
3. Alise checks the current data usage and selects to adjust the data limit or turn off data sharing.  
4. The system confirms the new settings, showing updated data limits or status changes.  
5. Alise can enable or disable the Wi-Fi hotspot with a simple toggle, and the system notifies her of the action's success.

**Alternative Scenario**  
1. Bob attempts to connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot but receives a "No connection available" message.  
2. Bob checks the vehicle's settings, and the subsystem displays a message that the hotspot is turned off due to exceeding the data limit.  
3. Bob is prompted to either reset the data limit or connect the vehicle to a different network.  
4. If Bob does not take action, the Wi-Fi remains unavailable until a valid connection is established.

**Postconditions**  
After successful interaction with the system, the user will either have their data limits updated, the Wi-Fi hotspot activated, or deactivated according to their preferences. Data usage is tracked and displayed in real-time, and notifications are sent if thresholds are met.
