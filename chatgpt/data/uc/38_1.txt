**1. Title**  
Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System

---

**2. Goal**  
The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System is designed to monitor the driver's behavior in real time, providing feedback to improve driving safety and efficiency. The system will track key parameters such as speed, acceleration, braking, lane changing, and other critical driving behaviors. It will alert the driver when unsafe or inefficient behaviors are detected, promoting better driving habits and reducing the risk of accidents. Additionally, it will generate periodic reports that summarize driving performance, offering insights for improvements.

**3. Preconditions**  
- The system must be integrated into the vehicle's onboard computer and sensor network.
- The vehicle must be equipped with necessary sensors such as GPS, accelerometers, cameras, and motion detectors.
- The driver must have an active user profile linked to the system.
- The system is initialized and operational, with calibration completed prior to use.
- The system should have a user-friendly interface accessible via the vehicle’s dashboard.

**4. Main Scenario**  
1. Alise enters the vehicle and starts the engine. The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System automatically activates.
2. Alise begins driving, and the system starts tracking real-time driving data such as speed, acceleration, braking, and lane usage.
3. The system continuously analyzes Alise's driving and provides visual or auditory feedback if any dangerous or inefficient behaviors (e.g., rapid acceleration, harsh braking) are detected.
4. Alise receives a summary of her driving performance on the dashboard screen after each trip, with suggestions for improving behavior (e.g., smoother braking, safer lane changes).
5. Alise checks the periodic report on her driving behavior through the vehicle’s system at the end of the week, noting improvements or areas requiring more attention.

**5. Alternative Scenario**  
1. Bob starts driving but the system malfunctions due to a sensor failure or technical issue.
2. The system shows an error message or fails to provide real-time feedback.
3. Bob continues driving without the monitoring system providing any feedback or performance data.
4. Upon returning the vehicle for maintenance, the technician discovers the sensor malfunction and repairs the system.
5. After repair, Bob is able to use the system again, with the previous trip’s data not being recorded, but future trips will be monitored.

**6. Postconditions**  
- After a successful interaction with the system, Alise receives feedback on her driving, along with actionable suggestions to improve her driving behavior.
- A report summarizing her driving performance over the specified time frame is generated, accessible via the vehicle’s dashboard or mobile app.
- If a malfunction occurs, the system logs the error for technical diagnosis, and the driver is informed that the monitoring system is temporarily unavailable until repaired.
