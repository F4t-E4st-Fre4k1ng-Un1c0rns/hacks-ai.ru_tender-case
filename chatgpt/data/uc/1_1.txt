Title: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration

Goal: The Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration sub-system enables secure, real-time data exchange between luxury electric vehicles within proximity. This feature allows cars to share essential information, such as road conditions, potential hazards, speed, and direction, to improve safety and streamline traffic flow. This seamless data-sharing enhances the driving experience by providing drivers with timely alerts and assists in avoiding potential collisions.

Preconditions:

Both vehicles participating in V2V communication must have the necessary hardware and software capabilities for V2V integration.
The vehicles must be within a specific range for secure, reliable data transmission.
V2V functionality must be enabled and connected to the vehicle's main control unit.
All vehicles involved are registered, licensed, and adhere to secure data-sharing protocols mandated by the manufacturer.
Main Scenario:

Action: Alice’s luxury electric car detects Bob’s car within communication range.
Response: Alice's car establishes a secure V2V communication link with Bob’s car.
Action: Alice’s car transmits its speed, direction, and road condition data to Bob’s car.
Response: Bob’s car receives and processes the data.
Action: Bob’s car detects a sudden stop or potential hazard ahead.
Response: Bob’s car sends an immediate alert to Alice’s car.
Action: Alice’s car receives the alert.
Response: Alice’s car displays the warning on her dashboard, suggesting deceleration.
Action: Alice decelerates as prompted.
Response: Both cars update each other on current speed and location for continuous monitoring.
Alternative Scenario:

Action: Alice’s car tries to initiate V2V communication with Bob’s car but finds the connection unstable.
Response: Alice’s car displays a notification that V2V data is temporarily unavailable.
Action: Alice’s car attempts reconnection after a short interval.
Response: If still unsuccessful, the system will notify Alice to proceed with caution and attempt to reconnect when possible.
Postconditions:

Following successful interaction, Alice’s car has safely adjusted its speed, and both vehicles continue to monitor each other’s status to prevent further potential hazards. The V2V integration improves traffic safety and enhances the situational awareness of drivers, ultimately contributing to a smoother, safer driving experience.
