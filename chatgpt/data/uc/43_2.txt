**Underpinning Contract for Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations**

1. **Title**  
   Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations

2. **Goal**  
   The Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations sub-system aims to monitor and analyze the fuel consumption of luxury electric vehicles. The system will provide the user with real-time feedback, efficiency reports, and personalized recommendations to optimize energy usage and improve overall performance. It will allow the user to track their driving habits, the vehicle's energy efficiency, and suggest improvements to achieve better mileage, cost savings, and sustainability. This feature will be particularly helpful in assisting users to monitor their consumption trends over time and make data-driven decisions to reduce their carbon footprint.

3. **Preconditions**  
   - The user must be driving a supported electric vehicle model equipped with the required sensors and data transmission capabilities.
   - The vehicle's battery and energy management system must be functioning correctly, with up-to-date software for optimal data collection.
   - The user must have registered for an account within the car's mobile application or onboard interface.
   - The Fuel Efficiency Tracking system must be activated and calibrated to the vehicle's current settings and user preferences.

4. **Main Scenario**  
   1. The user, Alise, enters her vehicle and starts the engine.  
   2. The system automatically begins tracking her fuel efficiency, gathering data from various vehicle sensors (e.g., energy consumption per mile, driving style, speed, acceleration).  
   3. While driving, Alise receives real-time feedback on the dashboard, including the current energy efficiency (e.g., miles per kilowatt-hour) and suggestions for improving driving habits, such as reducing rapid acceleration or braking.  
   4. At the end of her drive, Alise parks the vehicle, and the system generates a detailed report summarizing her energy usage, comparing it to historical data, and providing efficiency recommendations (e.g., route optimization, adjusting driving patterns).  
   5. Alise reviews the recommendations and chooses to apply some suggested improvements, such as moderating speed or using eco-driving mode for future trips.

5. **Alternative Scenario**  
   1. The user, Bob, starts his vehicle but notices that the Fuel Efficiency Tracking system is unresponsive or displays an error message.  
   2. Bob checks the vehicle's display and is prompted to ensure that the system is properly connected to the vehicle's energy management system and sensors.  
   3. If the issue persists, Bob is instructed to perform a system restart or update the vehicle's software via the vehicle's mobile app or service center.  
   4. In case of a temporary system failure, the Fuel Efficiency Tracking sub-system will notify Bob that fuel efficiency data will be unavailable until the issue is resolved, and the vehicle will continue to operate normally without feedback.  
   5. Bob is given the option to contact customer support or schedule a service appointment to resolve the issue and restore full functionality.

6. **Postconditions**  
   After successful interaction with the Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations sub-system:  
   - Alise or Bob will have access to an updated fuel efficiency report that reflects their most recent driving session.  
   - The system will have stored the user’s driving data for further analysis and future comparisons.  
   - The user will receive actionable recommendations for improving their energy efficiency and driving habits, contributing to a more sustainable and cost-effective driving experience.  
   - Any issues or errors in the system will have been either addressed, or the user will have been notified of steps to resolve them.
