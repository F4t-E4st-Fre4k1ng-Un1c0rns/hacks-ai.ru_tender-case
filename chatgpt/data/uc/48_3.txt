Vehicle Security System Integration with Home Automation  

**Goal**  
The Vehicle Security System Integration with Home Automation feature enables users to seamlessly link their luxury electric vehicle’s security system with their home automation network. This integration allows users to monitor, control, and automate security features of their vehicle in conjunction with their home systems, providing enhanced safety and convenience. Features include remote vehicle tracking, status updates, locking/unlocking controls, and syncing vehicle alerts with home automation notifications, allowing the user to manage their vehicle's security along with other home automation systems through a unified interface.

**Preconditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with a compatible security system and have access to a home automation network (e.g., smart home hub, security cameras, and alarms).
- The user must have a smartphone app or a home automation system capable of integrating with the vehicle's security features.
- A stable internet connection is required for real-time syncing and notifications between the vehicle security system and home automation platform.
- The user’s home automation system should be fully functional and have integrated security capabilities (such as door locks, cameras, and alarms).
  
**Main Scenario**  
1. Alise opens the home automation app on her smartphone and selects the "Vehicle Security" option from the menu.  
2. The system displays a dashboard with her luxury vehicle’s security status, including lock/unlock status, location, and any recent alerts.  
3. Alise decides to check if the vehicle is locked and taps the “Lock Vehicle” button on the app.  
4. The system sends a command to the vehicle, locking it remotely and updating the dashboard with the new status.  
5. Alise receives a confirmation notification on her phone confirming that the vehicle has been successfully locked, and she sees an updated status on the app.  

**Alternative Scenario**  
1. Bob opens the home automation app to access the "Vehicle Security" feature, but the app is unable to sync with the vehicle.  
2. An error message appears on the app stating, “Unable to connect to the vehicle’s security system at this time. Please check your connection.”  
3. Bob attempts to reconnect the app to the vehicle by refreshing the connection, but the issue persists.  
4. The app suggests troubleshooting steps, including checking the vehicle's internet connection and ensuring the home automation hub is online.  
5. Bob follows the instructions, and after restarting the vehicle’s security system, the app successfully reconnects, and he can manage the vehicle's security as usual.  

**Postconditions**  
After successful interaction with the system, the vehicle’s security features are remotely controlled as per the user’s commands. The system updates the vehicle’s status in real-time on the user’s app, and relevant notifications are sent to the user for any changes in the security status. For example, if the vehicle is locked remotely, the user will receive a confirmation message, and if an alert is triggered (e.g., a break-in attempt), the system will notify the user and trigger corresponding home automation actions (such as turning on lights or sounding alarms).
