The system will offer seamless interaction with emergency services such as towing, battery jump-start, flat tire assistance, and emergency fuel delivery. The user will be able to request help quickly, track the status of the service, and receive real-time updates on the arrival of assistance.

**4. Main Scenario**  
1. **User Action:** Alise, the driver, encounters a breakdown while driving and decides to request emergency roadside assistance via the vehicle's infotainment system.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system activates the Emergency Roadside Assistance interface and prompts Alise to confirm the nature of the emergency (e.g., breakdown, flat tire, etc.).
   
2. **User Action:** Alise selects "Breakdown" as the emergency type and presses the "Request Assistance" button.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system detects Alise’s location through GPS and sends an automatic request to the nearest available roadside assistance provider.
   
3. **User Action:** Alise receives a notification with the estimated time of arrival of the assistance vehicle.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system provides Alise with real-time tracking of the assistance vehicle, showing its location and estimated arrival time.
   
4. **User Action:** Alise stays in the vehicle and waits for assistance, using the system to stay updated.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system sends status updates regarding the assistance team's progress and sends a notification once the team is nearby.
   
5. **User Action:** The roadside assistance team arrives and resolves the issue, such as towing the vehicle or replacing the tire.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system confirms that the assistance was completed successfully and provides a summary of the service rendered to Alise.

**5. Alternative Scenario**  
1. **User Action:** Bob encounters a flat tire but is unable to use the Emergency Roadside Assistance Integration feature because the vehicle’s GPS signal is weak in a remote area.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system detects a weak or unavailable GPS signal and prompts Bob to manually enter his current location or use an alternative method (e.g., phone number) to contact roadside assistance.
   
2. **User Action:** Bob manually enters his location and requests assistance.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system proceeds to send the request to the nearest provider, but with a longer response time due to the manual location entry.
   
3. **User Action:** Bob is informed that there may be a delay in service.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system provides Bob with an updated estimated time of arrival and apologizes for the delay, giving Bob the option to cancel or continue waiting.
   
4. **User Action:** Bob chooses to continue waiting for assistance.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system continues to track the assistance team and sends timely status updates until the team arrives.

**6. Postconditions**  
After a successful interaction, the Emergency Roadside Assistance Integration will have resolved the user's emergency situation by dispatching the appropriate service. The user will receive a summary of the service provided, including the type of assistance (e.g., towing, battery jump-start) and the time taken for the assistance to arrive. The system will update the user’s service record and ensure all relevant charges are billed accordingly, if applicable.
