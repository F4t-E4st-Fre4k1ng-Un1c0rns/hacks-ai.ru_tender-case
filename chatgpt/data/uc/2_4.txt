**Title**  
Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance)

**Goal**  
The Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance) will provide users with the ability to automatically park their luxury electric vehicle in a variety of parking spaces, including parallel, perpendicular, and angled spaces, without the need for manual steering. The system will use advanced sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to detect available parking spaces and navigate the vehicle into the spot, ensuring the safety of the vehicle and surrounding objects. The user can activate the system with a simple command, and the system will take control of parking, improving ease of use and convenience.

**Preconditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary sensors, cameras, and software to enable the Driver-Assisted Parking System to function.
- The parking space must meet the size requirements for automated parking to be safely executed.
- The vehicle’s battery level must be sufficient to allow the parking process to be completed without interruption.
- The system is activated through a button or voice command, and the driver must remain in the vehicle during the process.

**Main Scenario**  
1. **User action**: Bob parks the car near an empty parking space and activates the Driver-Assisted Parking System by pressing a button on the dashboard.
   **Sub-System response**: The system scans the area and identifies a suitable parking space, providing feedback on the available space through the vehicle's display.
   
2. **User action**: Bob confirms that the system has detected the right parking spot by selecting "Start Parking" on the touchscreen or using a voice command.
   **Sub-System response**: The system begins the parking maneuver by controlling the steering, acceleration, and braking of the car to guide it into the spot.

3. **User action**: Bob remains in the vehicle with his foot off the brake pedal, while the system takes over the parking task.
   **Sub-System response**: The system parks the vehicle, continuously adjusting the speed and direction to fit the car perfectly into the space while avoiding obstacles.

4. **User action**: Bob monitors the parking process, but does not need to intervene unless prompted.
   **Sub-System response**: The system uses its sensors to detect any obstacles and makes adjustments to ensure a safe parking maneuver.

5. **User action**: Once the car is fully parked, Bob confirms that the system has successfully completed the parking task.
   **Sub-System response**: The system deactivates and provides a confirmation message on the display that the vehicle is parked safely and the task is complete.

**Alternative Scenario**  
1. **User action**: Alise attempts to use the Driver-Assisted Parking System in a crowded parking lot, but the system fails to detect a suitable parking space.
   **Sub-System response**: The system notifies Alise with a message on the screen that no appropriate parking spot is available, prompting her to either move closer to another area or manually park the car.
   
2. **User action**: Alise decides to attempt parking manually after receiving the system's alert.
   **Sub-System response**: The system deactivates and returns control of the vehicle to Alise, who parks the car herself.
   
3. **User action**: Alise encounters a problem where the parking sensors or cameras are obstructed by debris or dirt, preventing the system from functioning.
   **Sub-System response**: The system displays an error message, instructing Alise to clean the sensors or check for any obstacles obstructing the cameras.
   
4. **User action**: If Alise cannot clear the obstruction or resolve the issue, she is advised to park manually or schedule a service for maintenance.
   **Sub-System response**: The system disables itself until the issue is resolved, ensuring that the vehicle is safe to operate.

**Postconditions**  
- After a successful interaction with the Driver-Assisted Parking System, the vehicle will be safely parked in the designated parking space, and the system will provide confirmation to the user that the parking process has been completed.
- The system will automatically disengage and return full control of the vehicle to the driver once the parking task is successfully finished.
- The parking maneuver will be performed with minimal driver input, reducing stress and enhancing the user experience.
