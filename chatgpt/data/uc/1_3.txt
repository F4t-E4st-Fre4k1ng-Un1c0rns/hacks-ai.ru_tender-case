**Underpinning Contract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration**

---

**Goal**  
The Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration will allow vehicles to communicate with each other in real time. This feature enables safety alerts, traffic information exchange, and coordination among vehicles on the road. The V2V system enhances driving safety, improves traffic flow, and supports autonomous vehicle operations by sharing critical data such as vehicle speed, direction, location, and braking status.

---

**Preconditions**  
- Each vehicle must be equipped with compatible V2V communication hardware and software.
- Vehicles must be within the effective communication range for data exchange.
- The V2V system requires a stable, low-latency communication network for optimal performance.
- Users must enable V2V communication on their vehicles to participate in data sharing.

**Main Scenario**  
1. **User Action:** Bob’s car detects heavy traffic up ahead.  
   **System Response:** The V2V system broadcasts traffic congestion data to nearby vehicles, including Alise's car.

2. **User Action:** Alise’s car receives the traffic data and adjusts her route accordingly.  
   **System Response:** The V2V system provides an alternate route to avoid congestion.

3. **User Action:** Bob’s car brakes suddenly due to a hazard on the road.  
   **System Response:** The V2V system alerts nearby vehicles, including Alise's car, to take precautionary action.

4. **User Action:** Alise’s car automatically adjusts its speed in response to Bob's sudden braking.  
   **System Response:** The V2V system ensures smooth and safe deceleration of Alise's car to maintain a safe distance.

5. **User Action:** Bob and Alise’s cars continue on their route, with V2V continuously exchanging updates on vehicle status.  
   **System Response:** The system seamlessly shares real-time data to support ongoing safe and efficient driving.

**Alternative Scenario**  
- **User Action:** Alise attempts to connect to the V2V network in an area with low connectivity or where nearby vehicles do not support V2V.  
  **System Response:** The system alerts Alise of the network issue and falls back on regular vehicle safety measures without V2V assistance.

- **User Action:** Bob’s V2V hardware experiences a temporary malfunction.  
  **System Response:** Bob’s car notifies him of the malfunction, and the system deactivates V2V communication until the issue is resolved, alerting nearby vehicles where applicable.

---

**Postconditions**  
Upon successful interaction, the V2V system will have provided timely and effective communication between vehicles. This results in enhanced situational awareness, improved road safety, and optimized traffic flow. Both Bob and Alise experience smoother driving conditions with reduced risk of collision and delays.
