**Title:** Bluetooth-Based Vehicle Access System

**Goal:**  
The Bluetooth-Based Vehicle Access System enables seamless, keyless entry to the luxury electric vehicle by allowing the user to unlock and start the car through their smartphone or other Bluetooth-enabled device. This system offers enhanced convenience, security, and user experience, with additional features such as remote locking, proximity detection, and automatic vehicle entry detection.

**Preconditions:**  
- The vehicle is equipped with Bluetooth access technology.  
- The user has installed the dedicated mobile app on their smartphone.  
- Bluetooth is enabled on the user’s smartphone or device.  
- The vehicle’s Bluetooth system is active and within range.

**Main Scenario:**  
1. Bob approaches the vehicle with his smartphone in his pocket, which has the vehicle’s mobile app installed and Bluetooth enabled.  
2. The system detects Bob’s smartphone via Bluetooth when he is within proximity (e.g., 5 meters).  
3. The vehicle automatically unlocks the doors as Bob reaches for the handle.  
4. Bob enters the vehicle and places his foot on the brake.  
5. The vehicle starts automatically without the need for a physical key, based on the proximity and Bluetooth pairing with Bob's phone.

**Alternative Scenario:**  
1. Bob approaches the vehicle, but his smartphone’s Bluetooth is turned off or out of range.  
2. The system fails to detect the device and does not unlock the vehicle.  
3. The vehicle’s app sends an alert to Bob’s phone, notifying him that Bluetooth is disabled or the range is insufficient.  
4. Bob manually unlocks the car using the physical key or remote control.  
5. The system logs the failed attempt and prompts Bob to ensure Bluetooth is enabled for future use.

**Postconditions:**  
- After successful interaction, the vehicle’s doors remain unlocked, and Bob can start the vehicle without any further actions.  
- The system records the successful entry, and the Bluetooth connection remains active until the vehicle is turned off or the user exits the vehicle.
