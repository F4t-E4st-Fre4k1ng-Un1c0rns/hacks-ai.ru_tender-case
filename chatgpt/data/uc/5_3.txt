**2. Goal**

The Wireless Charging Station Integration for Electric Vehicles (EV) aims to provide seamless, efficient, and user-friendly wireless charging solutions for luxury electric vehicle owners. This sub-system enables the automatic charging of EVs without the need for physical plugs, improving convenience, reducing wear on charging ports, and offering faster charging speeds. The system allows users to park their vehicles over the designated charging spot, and the vehicle will automatically begin charging through wireless transmission technology.
