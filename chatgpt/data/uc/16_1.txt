**Underpinning Contract: Voice-Activated Climate Control System**

---

**Goal:**

The Voice-Activated Climate Control System allows the user to control the climate settings of the vehicle through voice commands. It provides the following abilities to the user:

1. Adjust the cabin temperature by specifying desired temperature settings (e.g., “Set the temperature to 22°C”).
2. Control air circulation modes such as fan speed, air conditioning, and heating with voice commands (e.g., “Turn on the air conditioning” or “Increase the fan speed”).
3. Select specific areas of the cabin for air distribution (e.g., “Direct air to the feet” or “Activate the rear-seat air vents”).
4. Control the defrosting system (e.g., “Defrost the windshield”).
5. Provide status updates when asked (e.g., “What is the current temperature in the car?”).

---

**Preconditions:**

1. The Voice-Activated Climate Control System is integrated into the vehicle’s main control unit and is activated upon vehicle start-up.
2. The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary hardware (microphone, speakers, and climate control interface) for voice recognition.
3. The system is trained to recognize a variety of commands in the user’s preferred language and accent.
4. User has completed initial setup and calibration, linking their voice profile to the system for personalized responses.
5. The vehicle must be in operation (engine running or in ‘accessory mode’) for climate control features to be functional.

**Main Scenario:**

1. **User Action:** Bob says, "Set the temperature to 22°C."
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system acknowledges the command and adjusts the cabin temperature to 22°C.
   
2. **User Action:** Bob asks, "Increase the fan speed."
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system increases the fan speed in the cabin to the next level.
   
3. **User Action:** Bob commands, "Direct air to the feet."
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system adjusts the air circulation to direct airflow to the feet area.
   
4. **User Action:** Bob requests, "Turn on the air conditioning."
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system activates the air conditioning, adjusting the climate accordingly to maintain the set temperature.
   
5. **User Action:** Bob inquires, "What is the current temperature in the car?"
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system responds with the current cabin temperature (e.g., “The current temperature is 21.5°C”).

---

**Alternative Scenario:**

1. **User Action:** Bob says, "Set the temperature to 25°C," but the system does not respond.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system acknowledges an issue with the voice recognition and responds, "I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. Please try again."
   
2. **User Action:** Bob repeats the command, but the system still fails to respond.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system responds, "There seems to be a temporary issue with the voice recognition system. Please adjust the climate manually using the vehicle controls."

3. **User Action:** Bob says, "Turn on the air conditioning," but there is no change.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system informs the user, "The air conditioning is currently unavailable due to a system malfunction. Please try again later."

4. **User Action:** Bob asks, "What is the current temperature in the car?" and gets no response.
   - **Sub-System Response:** The system responds, "I am unable to provide the temperature at the moment. Please use the manual controls for this information."

**Postconditions:**

1. If the user interacts successfully with the system, the desired climate setting (temperature, air circulation, fan speed, etc.) will be adjusted as instructed.
2. The system will provide feedback confirming the completion of the action (e.g., “The temperature is now set to 22°C” or “Fan speed increased”).
3. The system remains responsive to additional commands unless there is a failure or issue that requires user intervention (e.g., manual controls or system reset).
