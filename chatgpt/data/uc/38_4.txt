Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System

**Goal**  
The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System (DBMFS) aims to enhance vehicle safety and efficiency by continuously monitoring a driver’s behavior, providing real-time feedback, and generating insights on driving patterns. The system will be able to detect and analyze critical behaviors such as speed, acceleration, braking, and cornering, offering feedback to improve the driver's habits and overall driving performance. This feature will also provide notifications in case of unsafe driving, encourage eco-driving, and ensure compliance with traffic regulations for optimal vehicle operation.

**Preconditions**  
- The system is activated upon the vehicle’s ignition and will remain operational during driving.
- A driver profile is created, storing personalized data for feedback and behavior analysis.
- The vehicle is equipped with necessary sensors (e.g., speedometer, accelerometer, gyroscope) to capture driving metrics.
- The system is linked to the vehicle's onboard computer, enabling real-time data processing and feedback display on the dashboard or via mobile application.
- The driver has been briefed on how the system works and has consented to its data collection and usage.

**Main Scenario**  
1. Bob enters the vehicle, and the Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System activates upon starting the engine.
2. The system monitors Bob’s driving actions, analyzing metrics such as acceleration, braking, and cornering.
3. As Bob drives, the system provides real-time feedback on the dashboard, such as green indicators for safe behavior and red alerts for unsafe actions (e.g., harsh braking).
4. If Bob continues to drive in a manner that deviates from the optimal behavior (e.g., rapid acceleration), the system issues a warning with suggestions for improvement, such as "Gentle braking recommended."
5. After the trip, the system generates a summary report of Bob's driving behavior, offering insights on areas for improvement and eco-driving tips.

**Alternative Scenario**  
1. Alise enters the vehicle, but the Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System fails to activate due to a system error.
2. A notification appears on the dashboard, stating, "Driver Behavior Monitoring System unavailable. Please check system settings."
3. Alise acknowledges the message, and the system prompts her to restart the vehicle or contact customer support for assistance.
4. If the issue persists, Alise is advised to drive without the system active, with a manual warning about potential safety risks and the importance of maintaining safe driving practices.
5. Alise completes the trip and can later check with customer support to schedule a system diagnostic or repair.

**Postconditions**  
- After a successful interaction with the system, Bob receives a driving report summarizing his driving performance, including areas of improvement and eco-driving suggestions.
- The system stores the data securely for future reference, allowing Bob to track his progress over time.
- If Bob’s driving behavior is deemed optimal, he receives positive reinforcement, such as a badge or achievement within the system's interface, encouraging continued safe and efficient driving.
