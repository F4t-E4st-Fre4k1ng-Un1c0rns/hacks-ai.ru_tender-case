**Title:**
Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System

**Goal:**
The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System is designed to track and analyze the driving patterns of vehicle operators to promote safer, more efficient driving. This system will provide real-time feedback on driving behaviors, such as acceleration, braking, speed, and cornering. Additionally, it will give personalized recommendations and notifications to help improve driving habits, encourage fuel efficiency, and enhance overall safety. Users will also have access to detailed reports summarizing their driving behaviors over time.

**Preconditions:**
- The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System is installed and integrated into the vehicle's onboard diagnostics.
- The user must be logged into their personal profile on the vehicle’s infotainment system.
- The system requires active GPS and sensor data to monitor driving patterns.
- The user must have granted permission to collect driving data for analysis.

**Main Scenario:**
1. Alise starts the vehicle and begins driving. The system automatically detects her driving behavior, including acceleration, braking, and speed.
2. The system continuously monitors Alise's driving in real time, using sensors to assess performance and compare it against optimal safety and efficiency standards.
3. Alise receives real-time visual feedback via the dashboard display, alerting her if she is driving too fast, too aggressively, or with unsafe braking habits.
4. Based on her driving behavior, the system offers personalized feedback, such as “Try to accelerate more gently” or “Consider reducing speed to improve fuel efficiency.”
5. At the end of the drive, Alise receives a detailed summary report that highlights her driving performance, points out areas for improvement, and provides tips for better driving in the future.

**Alternative Scenario:**
1. Bob starts the vehicle but the system fails to detect the onboard sensors, possibly due to a malfunction in the system or GPS signal loss.
2. The system prompts Bob with an error message on the infotainment screen, notifying him that it is unable to track driving behavior due to sensor issues.
3. Bob is given the option to manually re-enable the system by checking the settings or to continue driving without monitoring.
4. If the issue persists, Bob is prompted to contact customer support or visit a service center for troubleshooting.
5. The system will automatically resume monitoring once the issue is resolved, or upon a system restart if necessary.

**Postconditions:**
- After a successful interaction with the system, Alise’s driving performance data is saved to her personal profile and can be reviewed at any time.
- Alise has received useful feedback on how to improve her driving behavior, contributing to better safety and fuel efficiency.
- If the system detects critical driving behavior issues, it may suggest further training or even provide automatic driving suggestions for enhanced safety in future trips.
