**Underpinning Contract for Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations**

1. **Title**  
Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations

2. **Goal**  
The Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations sub-System will provide the user with real-time alerts regarding road conditions such as wet surfaces, icy patches, potholes, or construction zones. Additionally, it will offer adaptive driving recommendations to optimize driving behavior based on the road conditions, ensuring a safer, more comfortable, and efficient driving experience. The system will adjust driving suggestions in response to changing weather conditions, road surface types, and traffic patterns to enhance vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, and safety.

3. **Preconditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the required sensors and connectivity features, including GPS, weather data integration, and road condition monitoring sensors.
- The user must have activated the Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations feature via the vehicle's interface.
- The system must have access to up-to-date data on road conditions, weather, and traffic.
- The system must be calibrated for the specific region and driving conditions where the vehicle is currently located.

4. **Main Scenario**  
1. Bob starts driving his vehicle and activates the Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations sub-System via the in-car display.
2. The system uses real-time data from road sensors and external weather sources to assess the current road conditions.
3. As Bob drives, the system continuously monitors the road and alerts him to any changes in road conditions, such as wet roads or icy patches, through visual and auditory notifications.
4. Based on the detected conditions, the system provides adaptive driving recommendations, such as adjusting speed, changing lanes, or activating specific vehicle features like traction control.
5. Bob follows the system's recommendations, ensuring safer driving and optimal vehicle performance, while the system updates in real-time to reflect any further changes in conditions.

5. **Alternative Scenario**  
1. Alise starts driving but the Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations sub-System fails to activate due to a connectivity issue or sensor malfunction.
2. The system displays a notification informing her that the feature is temporarily unavailable and advises her to manually monitor road conditions.
3. Alise may proceed to drive without the adaptive recommendations, relying on the vehicle’s standard driving assistance features.
4. The system will continue to display a status indicating the issue (e.g., "Road Condition Alerts unavailable") until the problem is resolved.
5. Alise can later re-enable the system after addressing the connectivity issue or when the malfunction is fixed, and the system will resume providing alerts and recommendations.

6. **Postconditions**  
After successfully interacting with the Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations system, Bob will have received timely alerts about road conditions and adaptive driving suggestions, which he has followed to improve safety and driving efficiency. The vehicle's performance will be optimized according to the system's real-time updates, and any changes in road conditions will be communicated to ensure ongoing safe operation. Additionally, if the system was temporarily unavailable, Alise would be notified and given an alternative, with the system resuming its full functionality once the issue is addressed.
