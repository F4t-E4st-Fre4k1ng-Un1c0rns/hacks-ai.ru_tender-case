**Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System - Underpinning Contract**

1. **Title**  
   Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System

2. **Goal**  
   The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System is designed to provide an intuitive and reliable mechanism for users to safely evacuate from the vehicle during emergency situations. It will automatically trigger when a life-threatening event is detected, providing clear instructions and guidance for evacuation, ensuring that all passengers can exit the vehicle swiftly and safely. This sub-system will feature automated emergency door unlocking, integrated guidance for escape routes, and emergency communication with rescue services.

3. **Preconditions**  
   - The system is integrated into the luxury electric car and activated during critical emergency situations.
   - The vehicle must be powered on for the system to be fully operational, though certain features may still function when the vehicle is powered off.
   - The system relies on sensors that detect fire, smoke, or collision impacts to activate.
   - User profile is registered in the car system with emergency contacts updated for timely communication.
   - The vehicle must be in a state of emergency, such as a crash, fire, or hazardous environment, for the system to engage.

4. **Main Scenario**  
   1. **Alise** is driving the vehicle when an emergency situation is detected, such as a severe collision or fire.  
   2. The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System immediately activates, and the vehicle’s doors unlock automatically.  
   3. The system provides a clear voice prompt to Alise, instructing her to exit through the nearest available exit route.  
   4. The system flashes an illuminated arrow on the interior display, directing Alise to the safest exit.  
   5. After Alise exits the vehicle, the system sends an automatic distress signal to emergency services with the car's location and details of the emergency.

5. **Alternative Scenario**  
   1. **Bob** is in the vehicle when a fire breaks out, but the automatic door unlocking feature malfunctions due to electrical failure.  
   2. The system detects the malfunction and alerts Bob with a visual prompt indicating a failure in the automatic unlocking system.  
   3. Bob is then instructed by the system to manually unlock the doors using the emergency door release.  
   4. If the manual unlocking also fails, the system will provide an alternate escape route through the window and give instructions on how to break the glass safely.  
   5. Once Bob exits the vehicle, the system ensures the distress signal is sent to emergency services despite the initial failures.

6. **Postconditions**  
   - After successful evacuation, the Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System has provided clear and efficient guidance, ensuring the safe exit of the user(s).
   - The system has sent an emergency notification to local authorities with the vehicle's exact location and emergency details, enabling a rapid response from rescue teams.
   - All system logs, including user interactions, actions taken, and system malfunctions (if any), are recorded for post-incident analysis and improvement.
