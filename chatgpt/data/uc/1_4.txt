**Title:**  
Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration  

**Goal:**  
The Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration subsystem enables luxury electric vehicles to communicate directly with other vehicles on the road. It enhances safety and convenience by providing real-time data exchange, allowing vehicles to share information such as speed, location, and driving intentions. This feature aims to prevent accidents, improve traffic flow, and enhance the overall driving experience. The system will alert drivers to potential hazards, assist in collision avoidance, and enable seamless navigation through connected infrastructure.

**Preconditions:**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the latest version of the V2V integration software.
- The communication system must be activated and paired with nearby vehicles equipped with compatible V2V technology.
- Both vehicles need to be within the communication range to exchange data.
- The vehicle's onboard network must be operational for V2V data transmission to occur.

**Main Scenario:**  
1. **Alise** starts her luxury electric car, which has the V2V communication system enabled.  
   - **System Response:** The V2V system automatically activates and begins scanning for nearby vehicles with V2V capability.  
2. **Alise** is driving on a highway, and a nearby car approaches from behind.  
   - **System Response:** The V2V system detects the other vehicle, exchanges data such as speed, and alerts Alise if the other vehicle is approaching too quickly.  
3. **Alise** begins to merge into another lane and turns on the blinker.  
   - **System Response:** The V2V system sends a signal to surrounding vehicles, including any in the adjacent lane, informing them of Alise’s lane change intention.  
4. **Alise** drives into an area with heavy traffic congestion.  
   - **System Response:** The V2V system informs Alise of nearby vehicles that may be slowing down or stopping, helping her to adjust her speed proactively.  
5. **Alise** approaches an intersection with a red light, but her vehicle receives a warning from a car in an adjacent lane.  
   - **System Response:** The V2V system alerts Alise of an upcoming hazard (e.g., a car running a red light) and recommends braking or evasive action.

**Alternative Scenario:**  
1. **Bob** starts his vehicle and notices the V2V system is disabled.  
   - **System Response:** The system prompts Bob to check the vehicle settings to ensure the V2V feature is activated.  
2. **Bob** drives down the road, but the V2V system fails to detect any nearby vehicles.  
   - **System Response:** The system displays an error message indicating that no compatible vehicles are in range or that the communication signal is weak.  
3. **Bob** approaches a busy intersection but the V2V system loses connectivity with other vehicles.  
   - **System Response:** The system notifies Bob that it cannot receive real-time data, advising him to proceed with caution and manually check for traffic.  
4. **Bob** tries to use the system’s lane-change feature, but the communication signal from surrounding vehicles is interrupted.  
   - **System Response:** The system alerts Bob that the lane-change warning may be delayed due to a temporary communication failure and suggests using the vehicle’s traditional sensors.  
5. **Bob** experiences an unexpected system shutdown during his drive.  
   - **System Response:** The system logs the error and instructs Bob to visit a service center for troubleshooting.  

**Postconditions:**  
- After a successful interaction with the V2V system, the vehicle’s driver is informed of surrounding traffic conditions, potential hazards, and the actions of nearby vehicles, leading to a safer and more efficient driving experience.
- If the V2V communication results in a successful hazard warning or collision avoidance, the vehicle’s safety systems may activate (e.g., emergency braking, alert sounds) to ensure driver protection.  
- The system will log all relevant data for later review, such as alerts and system performance, which can be accessed by service technicians if needed.
