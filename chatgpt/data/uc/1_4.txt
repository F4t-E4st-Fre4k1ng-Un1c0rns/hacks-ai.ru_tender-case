**Title:**  
Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration

**Goal:**  
The Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration enables direct data exchange between vehicles, enhancing real-time awareness and safety by sharing location, speed, and direction. This feature aims to provide the driver with timely alerts about nearby vehicles, traffic congestion, and potential hazards, contributing to a safer and more efficient driving experience.

**Preconditions:**  
1. Both vehicles must have V2V-enabled systems and be within a specified communication range.
2. The V2V system is activated and configured to share and receive data autonomously.
3. Vehicles must have compatible software versions for seamless communication.

**Main Scenario:**  
1. **User Action:** Alice activates the V2V system in her luxury electric vehicle.
   - **System Response:** The system initializes, scanning for nearby V2V-enabled vehicles.
2. **User Action:** Alice begins driving and enters a moderately busy highway.
   - **System Response:** The V2V system detects nearby vehicles, actively monitoring their speeds and trajectories.
3. **User Action:** A vehicle ahead of Alice suddenly brakes hard.
   - **System Response:** The V2V system immediately alerts Alice with a visual and auditory warning.
4. **User Action:** Alice decelerates promptly in response to the warning.
   - **System Response:** The system records Alice’s deceleration, alerting any V2V-enabled vehicles behind her.
5. **User Action:** Alice safely navigates past the area of congestion.
   - **System Response:** The V2V system resumes normal monitoring, providing updates as needed.

**Alternative Scenario:**  
1. Alice activates the V2V system, but there are no other V2V-enabled vehicles nearby.
   - **System Response:** The system informs Alice that no nearby vehicles are currently connected, and will continue searching in the background.
2. While driving, Alice encounters a temporary V2V system failure due to interference.
   - **System Response:** The system displays a notification indicating limited V2V functionality and suggests manual caution.

**Postconditions:**  
After successfully interacting with the V2V Integration system, Alice has driven safely through traffic, benefitting from real-time updates and early warnings about other vehicles' behavior. The system continues to operate in the background, ready to provide alerts for any new traffic situations.
