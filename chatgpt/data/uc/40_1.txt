**3. Main Scenario**  
1. **User enters a toll road or parking area**: Alise drives her car into a toll zone. The system automatically detects the toll booth or parking area.
2. **Payment detection and confirmation**: The In-Car Payment System prompts Alise with an on-screen notification about the toll/parking fee and asks for her confirmation to proceed with the payment.
3. **User confirms payment**: Alise selects "Confirm" on the screen to authorize the payment.
4. **Payment processing**: The system processes the payment in real time and provides a notification confirming successful payment, either through audio or a visual message.
5. **Completion**: Alise receives a receipt of the payment directly through the system and continues driving or parks without any additional action required.

**4. Alternative Scenario**  
1. **User enters a toll road or parking area**: Bob drives his car into a toll zone, but the system fails to detect the toll booth or parking facility.
2. **System error notification**: The In-Car Payment System notifies Bob that it was unable to detect the payment service or process the payment.
3. **User manually selects payment option**: Bob can manually select from a list of available payment options within the system’s menu (e.g., pay by card or app).
4. **Error persists or user decides to skip**: If the issue continues, Bob may be prompted to make the payment manually at the booth or parking meter.
5. **Payment confirmation and alternative steps**: Bob may receive a follow-up notification to ensure the toll or parking charge was paid successfully, either automatically after manual input or through the system's verification process.
