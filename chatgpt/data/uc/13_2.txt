**Goal**  
The In-Car Video Streaming Service Integration enables users to stream high-quality video content through the in-car entertainment system. It provides the ability to access a wide range of video streaming platforms and services, allowing users to watch their preferred movies, shows, and videos directly on the car's display screen while the vehicle is stationary. The service supports HD and 4K streaming and is optimized for minimal latency and smooth playback, ensuring an enjoyable viewing experience for the passengers.

**Preconditions**  
- The car must be equipped with the necessary hardware for video streaming (e.g., high-resolution display, internet connectivity, and multimedia system).
- The user must have a valid subscription to supported streaming services (e.g., Netflix, YouTube, Hulu).
- The car must be parked or in a stationary mode to ensure the safety of the driver and passengers while using the service.
- The user must be connected to a reliable Wi-Fi or cellular network for uninterrupted streaming.

**Main Scenario**  
1. The user, Bob, enters the car and ensures the vehicle is in park mode.
2. Bob opens the car's entertainment system interface and navigates to the "Video Streaming" section.
3. The system prompts Bob to log in to his streaming service account (if not already logged in).
4. Bob selects his preferred video streaming platform and browses through the available content.
5. Bob selects a video to watch, and the system starts streaming it on the in-car display with high-quality resolution and minimal buffering.

**Alternative Scenario**  
1. Bob enters the car and finds the video streaming service is not available due to a connectivity issue.
2. The system alerts Bob with an error message stating "No Internet Connection" or "Streaming Service Unavailable."
3. Bob is offered the option to check the Wi-Fi connection or switch to mobile data, and the system suggests troubleshooting steps.
4. If the problem persists, Bob can access offline content (if available) or exit the video streaming interface to use other entertainment options.
5. The system logs the error and provides Bob with a chance to retry the connection once it is restored.

**Postconditions**  
- Upon successful interaction, Bob enjoys uninterrupted video streaming on the car’s display, providing an enhanced in-car entertainment experience.
- The streaming session continues until the video ends, or Bob manually stops it. The system logs the session and tracks data usage for future reference, if applicable.
