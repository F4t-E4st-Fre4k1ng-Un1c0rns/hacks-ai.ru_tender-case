**Title:**  
Real-Time Parking Availability Notifications

**Goal:**  
The Real-Time Parking Availability Notifications sub-system will provide users with up-to-date information about available parking spaces in the vicinity of their destination. This feature will allow users to receive real-time notifications on parking availability, reducing the time spent searching for parking and improving the overall experience of owning and using a luxury electric vehicle. Users will be notified of nearby open parking spots, including their distance from the vehicle’s current location, and will have the option to navigate to them.

**Preconditions:**  
1. The user must have a compatible luxury electric vehicle equipped with the necessary sensors and communication capabilities for the parking system.
2. The user must have an active internet connection to receive real-time parking updates.
3. The sub-system must be enabled within the vehicle’s infotainment or mobile application interface.
4. The parking system relies on accurate and up-to-date location data provided by the vehicle's GPS and surrounding infrastructure, such as parking sensors or city databases.
5. The vehicle’s owner or driver (e.g., Alise or Bob) must have the appropriate user account and permissions set up to use the feature.

**Main Scenario:**  
1. Alise (or Bob) drives their vehicle to a destination where they need parking.
2. The vehicle’s system automatically detects the user’s location and checks for available parking spaces nearby.
3. The system displays a list of available parking spaces with distance, availability status, and other relevant details on the vehicle’s dashboard or mobile app.
4. Alise (or Bob) selects a parking spot and receives turn-by-turn directions to the chosen spot.
5. Upon arrival at the parking space, the system confirms the spot’s availability and provides a notification that the parking space is ready for use.

**Alternative Scenario:**  
1. Alise (or Bob) drives to a destination, but the system is unable to detect any available parking spaces due to a network failure or lack of nearby data sources.
2. The system displays a message notifying the user that parking availability information is currently unavailable.
3. The system offers alternative suggestions, such as a nearby parking lot or a prompt to try again later.
4. Alise (or Bob) chooses an alternative action, like manually searching for parking or continuing without the assistance of the real-time parking notifications.

**Postconditions:**  
1. If the parking spot was successfully found and selected, the user is guided to the chosen parking space and can park their vehicle without difficulty.
2. The system logs the parking event, noting the location and time of arrival, providing the user with a history of parking events for future reference.
3. If parking availability information was not received, the system records the failure and alerts the user that the feature was temporarily unavailable.
