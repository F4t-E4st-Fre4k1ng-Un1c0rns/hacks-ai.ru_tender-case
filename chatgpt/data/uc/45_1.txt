**Underpinning Contract: Personalized Recommendations for Entertainment and Music**

### 1. Goal
The "Personalized Recommendations for Entertainment and Music" sub-system will provide users with tailored suggestions for music, podcasts, and other forms of entertainment based on their preferences, behavior, and driving conditions. The feature will dynamically adapt to user tastes and moods, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable in-car entertainment experience. 

### 2. Preconditions
- The sub-system is integrated into the vehicle's infotainment system, and the user is authenticated via their personal profile (e.g., via a connected mobile device or login).
- The sub-system has access to the user's listening history, preferences, and any external sources like music streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.).
- The vehicle's internal sensors (e.g., for temperature, speed, time of day) are operational, enabling context-based recommendations.
- The vehicle's internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data) is stable, allowing streaming of content when required.

### 3. Main Scenario
1. **User initiates the system**: Bob starts the car, and the infotainment system prompts the user to choose an entertainment mode (music, podcast, etc.).
2. **User provides input**: Bob selects the “Music” option, and the system asks if Bob would like to hear a recommended playlist based on his past listening habits.
3. **Personalized recommendation**: The system, based on Bob’s profile and previous activity, suggests a playlist or album. Bob selects one of the recommendations.
4. **User feedback**: Bob listens to the recommended content and has the option to thumbs up or thumbs down songs, helping the system refine future suggestions.
5. **System adaptation**: The system records Bob’s preferences and uses this data to improve future recommendations, ensuring a personalized experience on future trips.

### 4. Alternative Scenario
1. **User interaction failure**: If the system cannot access the internet or streaming services due to connectivity issues, it informs Bob of the problem with a message, such as “Unable to connect to the music service. Please try again later.”
2. **Limited personalization**: If no prior listening data is available, the system will ask Bob to select a genre or mood (e.g., upbeat, relaxing) to create an initial playlist or recommend general content.
3. **Error handling**: If the sub-system cannot retrieve the recommended content, it provides a fallback option, such as a pre-loaded playlist or podcast, with a notification that a recommendation couldn’t be made at the moment.
4. **User choice**: Bob can manually search and select entertainment content if automatic recommendations are unavailable, ensuring that he still has control over the system despite the failure.

### 5. Postconditions
- After successful interaction, Bob receives an entertainment recommendation that aligns with his preferences, and the system logs his feedback to improve future suggestions.
- The system continuously learns from Bob’s feedback, refining the quality of the recommendations over time, ensuring a more personalized experience for future interactions. 
- In case of errors or connectivity failures, the system ensures that Bob is informed and can still enjoy content through alternative means (e.g., preloaded media or manual search).
