### 3. Preconditions  
- The fleet management platform is set up with connected electric vehicles.
- Each vehicle is equipped with sensors to capture data, such as speed, battery level, mileage, and health metrics.
- The fleet manager (e.g., Bob) has user credentials and access to the Vehicle Data Analytics dashboard.
- Vehicles must be regularly synced to the cloud system to ensure real-time data updates.
- The sub-System must be integrated with the fleet's central management software.

### 4. Main Scenario  
1. **User Login**: Bob logs into the fleet management dashboard using his secure credentials.
2. **Dashboard Access**: Bob navigates to the "Vehicle Data Analytics" section, where he is presented with an overview of all fleet vehicles, including current location, battery levels, and maintenance status.
3. **Data Monitoring**: Bob selects a specific vehicle from the fleet to review detailed performance metrics, such as energy consumption, driving behavior, and predictive maintenance alerts.
4. **Analysis & Reporting**: Bob uses the analytics tools to generate reports on the overall fleet performance, focusing on energy usage and maintenance needs, which help in decision-making for cost reduction and efficiency improvements.
5. **Actionable Insights**: Based on the insights, Bob schedules vehicle maintenance, adjusts fleet routes for optimal energy use, or identifies underperforming vehicles that need attention.

### 5. Alternative Scenario  
- **Scenario 1 - System Unavailable**:  
  If the system is down or cannot load data due to server issues, Bob is prompted with an error message indicating the unavailability of the Vehicle Data Analytics sub-System. He is advised to try again later or contact support if the issue persists.  
- **Scenario 2 - Data Sync Failure**:  
  If Bob selects a vehicle but the data fails to load because the vehicle has not synced recently, the system will show a warning that the data is outdated. Bob will be asked to manually trigger a sync or wait for the next automatic update.
- **Scenario 3 - No Connectivity**:  
  If Bob's device has no internet connection, he will receive a notification that the Vehicle Data Analytics feature cannot be accessed offline. The system will allow Bob to continue with limited functionality or advise him to reconnect to the internet.

### 6. Postconditions  
After successful interaction with the Vehicle Data Analytics sub-System, Bob receives an updated and accurate overview of the fleet's current status. The system will generate detailed reports and provide actionable insights that can be used to optimize fleet management. All data updates are successfully synced, and maintenance schedules or route changes are implemented as necessary to improve vehicle efficiency and reduce costs.
