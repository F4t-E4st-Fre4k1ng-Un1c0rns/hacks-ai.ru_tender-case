Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization

**Goal**  
The Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization feature allows the driver to personalize and fine-tune the adaptive cruise control settings to better suit their driving preferences. This includes adjusting the following:  
1. Desired following distance from the vehicle ahead.  
2. The sensitivity of acceleration and deceleration for smoother driving.  
3. Speed threshold settings, allowing the system to adapt to various driving conditions.  
4. Customization of alerts and notifications for speed changes and distance adjustments.  
5. Integration with other advanced driving features to ensure seamless control and safety.

**Preconditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the Adaptive Cruise Control System and have the necessary sensors and software enabled.  
- The vehicle's on-board system must be in an operational state, with no ongoing maintenance or software malfunctions.  
- The user (driver) must have access to the system settings via the vehicle's main console or touch screen.  
- The user must be familiar with basic vehicle operation and safety protocols related to cruise control functions.

**Main Scenario**  
1. The driver (Bob) accesses the vehicle's main control interface and selects the "Adaptive Cruise Control" customization option.  
2. The system displays the available settings for following distance, acceleration sensitivity, and speed threshold.  
3. Bob adjusts the following distance by selecting a preferred setting (e.g., "Close", "Medium", "Far").  
4. Bob fine-tunes the acceleration and deceleration sensitivity to suit his driving style.  
5. After making the adjustments, Bob saves the settings, and the system confirms that the new configurations are now active.

**Alternative Scenario**  
1. Bob attempts to adjust the Adaptive Cruise Control settings but encounters an error message stating that the system is temporarily unavailable.  
2. Bob checks the vehicle’s diagnostic screen and sees that the adaptive cruise control system requires a software update.  
3. Bob is advised to proceed with the update via the on-board system or visit the nearest service center for the required upgrade.  
4. Bob exits the customization menu and continues driving with the standard cruise control settings until the update is completed.  
5. If the system remains unavailable, Bob is informed that the adaptive features will not be functional until the system update is applied.

**Postconditions**  
After Bob successfully customizes the Adaptive Cruise Control system, the system applies the new settings, and the vehicle operates according to the personalized preferences. The adjusted following distance, acceleration sensitivity, and speed threshold are now reflected in the driving experience, offering a tailored cruise control experience based on Bob's selections.
