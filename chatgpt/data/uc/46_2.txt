**Underpinning Contract: Automatic Synchronization of Vehicle Settings across Multiple Devices**

**1. Title**  
Automatic Synchronization of Vehicle Settings across Multiple Devices

**2. Goal**  
This sub-System allows users to automatically synchronize their preferred vehicle settings (e.g., seat position, climate control, driving modes, and infotainment preferences) across multiple authorized devices. The feature offers a seamless transition by adapting the vehicle’s environment to each user's preferred settings when switching between personal devices or vehicles within the brand's ecosystem. This enhances the user experience by reducing the need for manual adjustments.

**3. Preconditions**  
- The user (e.g., Alice or Bob) has registered an account with the vehicle manufacturer’s service and has linked multiple devices (e.g., smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch) to this account.
- The vehicle and all associated devices are connected to the internet and authenticated within the manufacturer’s system.
- The system settings and permissions for synchronization are enabled in the user’s profile on each device.

**4. Main Scenario**  
1. **User Action**: Alice enters the vehicle and logs in using her preferred device (e.g., smartphone).
   - **System Response**: The system identifies Alice’s profile and initiates synchronization with her preset vehicle settings.

2. **User Action**: Alice selects the option to load her personal settings from her device.
   - **System Response**: The system loads Alice's preferred settings (seat position, climate control, etc.) and applies them in the vehicle.

3. **User Action**: Alice adjusts any specific settings (e.g., climate control temperature) as needed during her trip.
   - **System Response**: The system saves these adjustments in real time, storing them as Alice's latest preferences.

4. **User Action**: Alice ends her trip, and the vehicle shuts down.
   - **System Response**: The system updates Alice’s profile on all connected devices, saving any new preferences to her account.

5. **User Action**: Alice later accesses her settings from another device or vehicle.
   - **System Response**: The system automatically applies Alice’s last saved preferences from the cloud to the new vehicle or device.

**5. Alternative Scenario**  
- If synchronization fails (e.g., due to loss of internet connectivity or a system error):
  1. **User Action**: Alice attempts to log in and notices her settings are not applied automatically.
     - **System Response**: The system displays an error message indicating a failure to connect to the server or load settings.
  2. **User Action**: Alice can manually adjust her vehicle settings.
     - **System Response**: The system stores these manual adjustments locally until connectivity is restored.
  3. **User Action**: Upon restoring connectivity, Alice reattempts synchronization.
     - **System Response**: The system uploads her manual settings and synchronizes them across all devices.

**6. Postconditions**  
After successful interaction with the sub-System, the user’s most recent preferences are saved and accessible across all linked devices. Future vehicle sessions will automatically load these saved settings, ensuring a seamless and personalized driving experience.
