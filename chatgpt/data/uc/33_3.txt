**Underpinning Contract: User Authentication and Authorization for Car Access**

**1. Title**  
User Authentication and Authorization for Car Access

**2. Goal**  
The User Authentication and Authorization for Car Access subsystem will enable users to securely access and control their luxury electric cars through a digital interface. It will provide features such as:
- Secure login and authentication to verify the identity of the car owner.
- Role-based access control to restrict certain functionalities based on the user's credentials.
- Authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authenticated users can interact with the vehicle's systems.
- Ability to add and manage multiple users with different access privileges.
- Real-time monitoring of user access and activity on the car.

**3. Preconditions**  
- The user must have an active account in the car manufacturer's system, including a valid email address, password, and associated vehicle(s).
- The car must be connected to the vehicle's digital infrastructure, supporting remote authentication protocols.
- The system must have internet connectivity to verify user credentials and update access logs.
- Users must have a valid mobile device or digital key capable of interacting with the car's authentication system.
- The system must support multiple user profiles with configurable access levels (e.g., Owner, Driver, Guest).

**4. Main Scenario**  
1. The user, Alise, approaches her luxury electric car and opens the car's mobile application or digital key interface.
2. Alise is prompted to authenticate using her credentials, such as entering a password or scanning her fingerprint on the mobile device.
3. The subsystem verifies Alise's credentials against the system database. If the authentication is successful, the system checks her access permissions based on her user role (e.g., Owner).
4. Upon successful authorization, Alise gains access to the car's controls and can perform actions like unlocking doors, starting the car, or adjusting vehicle settings.
5. The system logs Alise’s access event, including the time, location, and actions taken, for security monitoring and auditing purposes.

**5. Alternative Scenario**  
1. The user, Bob, approaches his car and attempts to authenticate through the mobile app, but his credentials are incorrect.
2. The system notifies Bob with an error message stating that the authentication has failed and prompts him to try again or reset his password.
3. Bob tries to reset his password via the provided link, but he does not have internet connectivity, so he cannot complete the process.
4. The system suggests an alternative method, such as calling customer support or using a backup physical key to access the car temporarily.
5. Bob may also try to authenticate via another device if the current one is malfunctioning, or choose to wait until the connection is restored.

**6. Postconditions**  
- After a successful authentication and authorization, the user (Alise) gains access to the car's features and functionalities based on their predefined access level.
- The car's system logs all actions taken by the user for security purposes.
- The system maintains an updated status of the user’s access history and will alert administrators of any suspicious or unauthorized attempts to access the vehicle.
