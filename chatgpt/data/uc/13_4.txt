**Title: In-Car Video Streaming Service Integration**

**Goal:**  
The In-Car Video Streaming Service Integration aims to provide a seamless and immersive entertainment experience for users by allowing them to stream high-quality video content directly through the car's infotainment system. The service will feature a user-friendly interface for selecting and playing video content, including movies, shows, and online streaming services. The system will ensure stable connectivity and optimal playback quality, ensuring entertainment during long trips or idle times within the car.

**Preconditions:**  
1. The car's infotainment system must be equipped with a compatible operating system and internet connectivity (Wi-Fi or cellular data).
2. The user must have an active subscription or access to a streaming service integrated into the system (e.g., Netflix, YouTube, etc.).
3. The car must have sufficient hardware capabilities (e.g., display, sound system) to ensure smooth video streaming.
4. The user must log into the system with their credentials if required by the streaming service.
5. The vehicle’s software must be updated to the latest version to support the integration of the video streaming service.

**Main Scenario:**
1. **Alise enters the car and turns on the infotainment system**. The system initializes and displays the home screen with available apps.
2. **Alise selects the 'Video Streaming' app** from the main menu. The app loads and displays a list of available streaming platforms.
3. **Alise selects a streaming service (e.g., Netflix)** and logs in using her credentials if necessary.
4. **Alise browses available content** and selects a video to watch. The video begins to stream on the car's display screen.
5. **Alise enjoys the video streaming**, with options to pause, rewind, fast forward, or change the video quality as needed, all through the infotainment system's interface.

**Alternative Scenario:**
1. **Bob enters the car and attempts to use the video streaming service**, but the system displays an error message indicating no internet connection.
2. Bob attempts to reconnect the system to Wi-Fi or cellular data. If unsuccessful, the system suggests troubleshooting steps, like restarting the connection or checking for available networks.
3. If no internet connection is available, the system suggests offline video options, such as previously downloaded content or connecting to a mobile hotspot.
4. If Bob cannot connect to the streaming service, the system offers alternative entertainment options like music or games.
5. If the video streaming service fails to load due to an internal error, the system displays an error message and offers to retry or access help for further support.

**Postconditions:**
- After successful interaction with the In-Car Video Streaming Service Integration, Alise or Bob can watch their chosen video content with a stable connection and high-quality playback. The car's infotainment system remains responsive to additional user inputs such as pausing, skipping, or adjusting volume. The video stream continues until the user stops it or the vehicle is turned off.
