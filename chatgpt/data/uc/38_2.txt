**Title**  
Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System

**Goal**  
The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System will provide real-time tracking and analysis of the driver’s behavior, delivering feedback to enhance driving safety and efficiency. It will monitor key factors such as speed, braking, acceleration, lane changes, and other indicators of safe driving, offering both immediate and summarized feedback. The system aims to improve the overall driving experience by encouraging safe habits and providing guidance to reduce the risk of accidents and enhance energy efficiency.

**Preconditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary sensors and software to track driver behavior, including cameras, accelerometers, and GPS.
- The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System must be activated at the start of each journey.
- The system must be calibrated and properly connected to the vehicle’s internal systems (e.g., speedometer, braking system, etc.).
- The driver must have agreed to the monitoring features and be informed of the data collection, as part of the vehicle's terms of use.

**Main Scenario**  
1. **Driver enters the vehicle** – Alise enters the vehicle and starts the engine, triggering the activation of the Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System.
2. **System begins monitoring** – The system automatically begins tracking key aspects of Alise’s driving behavior such as speed, acceleration, braking, and lane changes.
3. **Driver receives real-time feedback** – As Alise drives, the system provides real-time feedback through the dashboard display, indicating safe or unsafe driving patterns. For example, it may alert her if she accelerates too quickly or brakes harshly.
4. **Driver adjusts behavior** – Based on the feedback, Alise adjusts her driving habits to align with the system’s recommendations for safer and more efficient driving.
5. **Summary provided after the trip** – After Alise finishes her journey, the system provides a summary report that includes an overall safety score, areas for improvement, and any critical alerts from the trip.

**Alternative Scenario**  
1. **System fails to initialize** – Bob enters the vehicle, but the Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System does not activate when the engine is started.
2. **System error notification** – The vehicle displays an error message on the dashboard indicating a system failure or connection issue.
3. **Driver attempts to restart the system** – Bob tries to restart the system by switching off the engine and then turning it back on, but the error persists.
4. **Limited functionality or no feedback** – Without proper system initialization, Bob does not receive any feedback or monitoring data during the trip.
5. **Driver manual intervention** – Bob is instructed to contact customer support for troubleshooting, and a temporary notification may suggest driving safely without the system's feedback until the issue is resolved.

**Postconditions**  
- After a successful trip, Alise receives a detailed feedback report that includes her driving performance, safety rating, and energy consumption data, allowing her to track improvements and make informed decisions for future driving.
- The system logs the trip data for future reference, which can be accessed by Alise or used by the company for further analysis of driving patterns.
