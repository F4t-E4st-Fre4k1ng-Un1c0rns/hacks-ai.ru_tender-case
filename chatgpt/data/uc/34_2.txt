Integration of Third-Party Apps into Car Infotainment System

**Goal**  
The Integration of Third-Party Apps into the Car Infotainment System aims to enhance the in-car experience by allowing users to seamlessly access and interact with popular third-party applications such as music streaming, navigation, and communication apps through the car’s infotainment interface. This feature provides users with the convenience of controlling apps directly from the car's touchscreen or through voice commands, ensuring a smooth and integrated driving experience while maintaining focus on the road.

**Preconditions**  
- The vehicle's infotainment system must be powered on and properly initialized.  
- The car's infotainment system must be connected to the internet either via mobile hotspot, Wi-Fi, or cellular network.  
- The user’s third-party apps must be compatible with the car's infotainment system (e.g., through Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, or proprietary integration).  
- The user must have the required third-party apps installed on their mobile device or linked to the car's system.  
- The car's system must support necessary updates and software versions for third-party app integration.

**Main Scenario**  
1. The user, Alise, enters the car and starts the engine, which powers up the infotainment system.  
2. Alise navigates to the “Apps” section of the infotainment screen and selects the desired third-party app, such as a music streaming app or a navigation app.  
3. The infotainment system automatically connects to Alise’s linked mobile device, or accesses cloud data if the app supports such a function, and the app interface appears on the screen.  
4. Alise interacts with the app by either selecting options directly on the touchscreen or using voice commands to control playback, route navigation, or other app features.  
5. The infotainment system displays real-time data from the app, such as music track details, route instructions, or messages, allowing Alise to stay engaged without distraction.

**Alternative Scenario**  
1. If the third-party app fails to connect or isn’t available at the moment (due to network issues, app compatibility, or failure to sync), the infotainment system will display an error message indicating the problem.  
2. Bob, the user, is prompted with troubleshooting steps, such as checking the network connection, ensuring the app is installed and up-to-date, or ensuring Bluetooth/USB connections are active.  
3. If the issue persists, Bob is given the option to access alternative features of the infotainment system, such as built-in navigation or radio, until the third-party app integration is restored.  
4. If the third-party app becomes available again, the system will notify Bob that the app can now be reconnected, allowing him to try accessing it once more.

**Postconditions**  
- Upon successful integration and interaction with a third-party app, the infotainment system displays the selected app's content, allowing the user to engage with it fully.  
- The app operates as intended, with all features available for user interaction (e.g., streaming music, displaying navigation instructions, reading messages).  
- The system maintains the connection with the app throughout the drive, ensuring continued access unless disconnected by the user or due to external issues like network failure or app termination.
