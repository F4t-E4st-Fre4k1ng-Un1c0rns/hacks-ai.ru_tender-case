**Underpinning Contract for Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations**

**1. Title**  
Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations

**2. Goal**  
The Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations sub-system will provide users with real-time notifications about road conditions ahead, such as obstacles, weather-related hazards, or irregularities in road surfaces (e.g., potholes, wet roads). Additionally, it will offer adaptive driving recommendations based on the current road conditions, speed limits, and the vehicle's surroundings. This will improve driving safety, comfort, and efficiency by proactively adjusting driving behavior and alerting the driver of potential hazards.

**3. Preconditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary hardware, including sensors, cameras, GPS, and communication systems, to collect and transmit road condition data.
- The user must have enabled the Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations feature through the vehicle's settings.
- The system must be connected to a real-time data feed that provides road condition information, including traffic reports, weather updates, and live hazard notifications.
- The system must be calibrated to the vehicle’s parameters, including driving mode, maximum speed, and handling capabilities.

**4. Main Scenario**  
1. Alise begins driving the car on a highway. The system detects upcoming rain and road slickness through its sensors.
2. A notification appears on the dashboard, alerting Alise of the wet road conditions and recommending a reduced speed of 10 mph below the current speed limit.
3. Alise confirms the recommendation by tapping "Accept" on the screen, and the vehicle automatically adjusts its speed to align with the suggested safety recommendation.
4. The system continuously monitors the road conditions and updates Alise on any changes, such as new hazards or improving road conditions.
5. If the system detects any sudden hazards, like debris on the road, it will alert Alise immediately and suggest a safe maneuver (e.g., steering to the left or slowing down).

**5. Alternative Scenario**  
1. Bob starts driving in an area with poor road conditions (e.g., fog or snow), but the system’s sensor network temporarily loses connection due to signal interference or a malfunction in the weather data feed.
2. The system alerts Bob that it is unable to provide road condition data and recommends that he drive cautiously and manually adjust his speed as needed.
3. Bob acknowledges the notification, and the vehicle operates in a default safety mode, which reduces speed to a predefined lower threshold until the connection is restored.
4. Once the system regains connection to the data feed, it will resume providing road condition alerts and adaptive driving recommendations.
5. If the system cannot regain connection within a reasonable timeframe, Bob will be prompted to contact customer support or visit a service center for troubleshooting.

**6. Postconditions**  
After a successful interaction with the Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations system, Alise or Bob will experience enhanced safety and driving comfort. The vehicle will adjust its driving behavior based on real-time road conditions, offering proactive notifications and adaptive suggestions. The driver will feel more confident, knowing that the system helps maintain safe driving speeds and anticipates road hazards. If any issues arise, such as a temporary loss of service, the driver will be provided with guidance on how to proceed safely until the system is fully operational again.
