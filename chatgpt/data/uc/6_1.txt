**4. Main Scenario**  
1. **User Action:** Bob starts the vehicle and activates the Personalized Navigation System using a voice command, saying, “Navigate to the nearest charging station.”  
   **System Response:** The system acknowledges the command and displays the nearest charging station on the map, along with a voice prompt, "Navigating to the nearest charging station."  

2. **User Action:** Bob confirms the route, either verbally by saying, “Confirm” or via the touch screen.  
   **System Response:** The system provides an estimated time of arrival (ETA) and starts giving step-by-step voice directions for the journey.  

3. **User Action:** Bob says, “Avoid tolls” during the journey.  
   **System Response:** The system recalculates the route to avoid toll roads and informs Bob, “Recalculating route to avoid tolls.”  

4. **User Action:** Bob requests an alternate route by saying, “Show alternate routes.”  
   **System Response:** The system displays alternative routes on the screen and provides voice options for Bob to choose from.

**5. Alternative Scenario**  
1. **User Action:** Bob asks the system to navigate to a destination, but the system fails to respond.  
   **System Response:** The system prompts, “I am unable to process your request at the moment. Please try again later.”  

2. **User Action:** Bob tries again, but the system still doesn’t respond.  
   **System Response:** The system suggests troubleshooting steps, saying, “Please ensure the microphone is not obstructed, and check if the vehicle is connected to the internet. Would you like to try again?”

**6. Postconditions**  
After a successful interaction, Bob receives accurate, real-time navigation guidance to his selected destination. The system remembers his preferences for future trips, such as preferred routes, traffic preferences, or nearby charging stations. If voice commands were used, the system’s performance would improve with additional personalized feedback, optimizing future responses. The vehicle will also maintain an updated route to ensure the most efficient path is followed, accounting for traffic, weather, and road conditions.
