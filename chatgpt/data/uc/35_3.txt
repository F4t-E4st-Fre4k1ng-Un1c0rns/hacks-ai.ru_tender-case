**Title:**  
Driver Fatigue Detection and Alert System

**Goal:**  
The Driver Fatigue Detection and Alert System is designed to enhance driver safety by monitoring signs of driver fatigue and alerting the driver if fatigue levels reach a critical threshold. The system will analyze driver behavior, including eye movement, head position, and steering patterns, to detect fatigue. Upon detecting signs of fatigue, the system will issue timely alerts to prevent potential accidents caused by drowsy driving. Additionally, it will offer suggestions for breaks and notify the vehicle's central system for potential follow-up actions.

**Preconditions:**  
1. The vehicle is equipped with a working Driver Fatigue Detection and Alert System.
2. The system is enabled and calibrated according to the driver's specific settings and preferences.
3. The driver has been driving for a sufficient amount of time, during which the system continuously monitors their behavior and physiological signs.
4. The driver is seated in the driver's seat, and the vehicle is operating in an environment where the system can effectively monitor and assess fatigue risk (e.g., clear visibility, safe driving conditions).

**Main Scenario:**  
1. Bob starts driving the luxury electric car on a long journey.
2. The Driver Fatigue Detection and Alert System monitors Bob's behavior, tracking signs of drowsiness or fatigue (e.g., head nodding, erratic steering, blinking frequency).
3. After a prolonged period of driving without breaks, the system detects that Bob’s fatigue levels are rising beyond the acceptable threshold.
4. The system triggers a visual and auditory alert, notifying Bob with a warning message: "Driver Fatigue Detected: Please take a break."
5. Bob follows the recommendation and takes a break to rest and recharge, ensuring he can continue driving safely.

**Alternative Scenario:**  
1. Bob starts driving the car, but the Driver Fatigue Detection and Alert System fails to initialize due to a technical issue (e.g., sensor malfunction or software error).
2. The system does not detect fatigue and does not issue any alerts.
3. Bob continues driving for an extended period without receiving any warnings about fatigue.
4. Upon noticing this, Bob manually checks the system's status via the vehicle’s interface, which displays an error message indicating the system is currently unavailable.
5. Bob proceeds to use manual checks, such as frequent stops or relying on personal fatigue cues, to maintain safe driving. The system will be repaired or recalibrated after the journey.

**Postconditions:**  
1. After a successful interaction with the Driver Fatigue Detection and Alert System, Bob has received adequate warnings about fatigue and is prompted to take a break.
2. The system logs the fatigue event and alerts in the vehicle’s records, providing data for future analysis or safety improvement efforts.
3. Bob continues driving with a reduced risk of fatigue-related accidents after following the system's recommendation.
