Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring

---

**2. Goal**  
The Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring sub-system is designed to ensure that the vehicle adheres to legal speed limits and offers real-time alerts to the driver when approaching or exceeding these limits. This sub-system will provide the following key features:
- Continuous monitoring of vehicle speed in relation to the posted speed limits on the current route.
- Visual and auditory alerts to notify the driver when the vehicle exceeds the speed limit.
- Automatic adjustment of speed limit thresholds based on the vehicle's current location, including updates from GPS and map data.
- Logging of speed violations and compliance status for review or reporting.
- Integration with the vehicle's driver assistance systems, including cruise control and speed regulation, to help ensure compliance.

**3. Preconditions**  
- The vehicle is equipped with GPS, speed sensors, and map data integration to accurately determine the vehicle's current location and the applicable speed limits.
- The sub-system must be properly configured and calibrated during vehicle setup to ensure correct speed limit data and alert thresholds.
- The driver must have basic knowledge of the vehicle’s controls, including the speedometer and alert indicators.

**4. Main Scenario**  
1. The driver, Bob, enters the vehicle and starts driving. The vehicle's speed limit monitoring system is automatically activated.
2. As Bob drives, the system continuously compares the vehicle's current speed with the legal speed limits based on the GPS data.
3. If Bob exceeds the speed limit, the system triggers an auditory beep and displays a visual warning on the dashboard screen, indicating the speed limit breach.
4. Bob reduces his speed back within the legal limit, and the system stops the alert and returns to normal monitoring mode.
5. Throughout the drive, the system updates any changes in speed limits based on the vehicle’s current location and notifies Bob if any new speed limit restrictions are applicable.

**5. Alternative Scenario**  
1. Bob enters the vehicle, but the speed limit monitoring system fails to activate due to a GPS signal issue.
2. The system displays an error message on the dashboard: "Speed Limit Monitoring unavailable. GPS signal lost."
3. Bob continues driving, but the vehicle does not provide real-time speed limit alerts or compliance monitoring.
4. Bob pulls over and tries restarting the vehicle, hoping to resolve the GPS connectivity issue.
5. Once the GPS signal is restored, the system automatically activates again, and normal speed limit monitoring resumes. A message is displayed: "Speed Limit Monitoring reactivated."

---

**6. Postconditions**  
- After successful interaction with the sub-system, Bob will have received alerts for any speed violations and will have been reminded to comply with local speed limits.
- The system logs all speed limit breaches and compliance data, which may be reviewed by Bob or the system administrator if needed.
- The vehicle’s overall driving experience is enhanced by continuous, automated speed limit compliance and safety notifications.
