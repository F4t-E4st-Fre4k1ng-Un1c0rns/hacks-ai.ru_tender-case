Driver Fatigue Detection and Alert System

**Goal:**  
The Driver Fatigue Detection and Alert System aims to monitor and assess the driver’s alertness and fatigue levels in real-time. The system uses advanced sensors, including facial recognition, eye-tracking, and steering behavior analysis, to detect signs of fatigue. If the system identifies that the driver is becoming drowsy or is at risk of falling asleep, it will issue a timely alert to warn the driver and prompt them to take a break.

**Preconditions:**  
1. The vehicle is equipped with the necessary sensors and cameras (e.g., facial recognition, eye-tracking) to monitor the driver’s physical state.
2. The Driver Fatigue Detection and Alert System is activated and fully operational before the vehicle begins operation.
3. The system must be calibrated for the specific driver (e.g., recognizing their face, eye patterns) to ensure accurate detection.
4. The driver must be seated in the driver's seat and the seatbelt must be fastened to ensure proper monitoring.
5. The system requires the driver to be in full control of the vehicle, with the car moving at a speed above a minimum threshold (e.g., 30 km/h).

**Main Scenario:**
1. Alise starts driving the car, and the Driver Fatigue Detection and Alert System activates automatically.
2. The system monitors Alise’s facial expressions, eye movement, and steering behavior.
3. After some time, the system detects that Alise's eyes are closing for extended periods, indicating early signs of fatigue.
4. The system immediately triggers an alert, such as a visual and audio warning on the dashboard, prompting Alise to take a break.
5. Alise acknowledges the alert and pulls over at a safe location to rest before continuing her journey.

**Alternative Scenario:**
1. Bob starts driving, and the system activates as usual.
2. The system begins monitoring his alertness but encounters an error with the facial recognition camera due to low lighting conditions inside the vehicle.
3. The system cannot reliably detect Bob’s fatigue levels and displays a message on the dashboard saying "Fatigue Detection Unavailable – Please Ensure Proper Lighting."
4. Bob continues driving, but the system cannot provide a fatigue alert due to the sensor failure.
5. If the lighting conditions improve or the error is resolved, the system resumes monitoring and provides alerts as needed.

**Postconditions:**
1. After a successful interaction with the system, Alise receives an alert when her fatigue level is detected as high, prompting her to stop and rest.
2. Bob continues to drive, but the system’s error prevents fatigue detection until the issue is resolved, meaning no fatigue alert is issued during this period.
3. Once the system resumes full functionality, it continues to monitor Bob's alertness and will provide future alerts as needed based on his fatigue levels.
