**Underpinning Contract: Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System**

---

**Goal**

The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System is designed to provide users with a quick, safe, and efficient means of evacuating the vehicle in the event of an emergency. This sub-system enhances the standard evacuation protocols with advanced features such as automatic door unlocking, emergency lighting, audible alerts, and real-time assistance for escape routes. The system ensures that in case of an emergency, users can evacuate with minimal confusion and maximum safety.

---

**Preconditions**

- The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System is integrated and fully functional within the luxury electric vehicle.
- The vehicle’s emergency evacuation feature is activated through sensors detecting specific emergency conditions (e.g., crash detection, fire, or smoke).
- The system can be manually triggered by the user or automatically activated by the vehicle’s onboard safety protocols.
- The user must have access to the vehicle's interior, either through normal entry or emergency unlocking.

**Main Scenario**

1. **Activation**: In the event of an emergency, such as a collision or fire, the Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System automatically detects the situation.
2. **Audible Alert**: Upon activation, an audible alert (such as a loud siren or voice message) is emitted to notify the users about the evacuation need.
3. **Automatic Unlocking**: The system automatically unlocks all doors and windows, including any child safety locks, to allow quick exit from the vehicle.
4. **Emergency Lighting**: If necessary, emergency lighting is activated, illuminating the exits, escape paths, and the surrounding area to guide users towards safety.
5. **Evacuation Assistance**: If the user is unable to evacuate on their own, the system provides real-time guidance through an interactive display or a voice assistant to assist in a safe exit.

---

**Alternative Scenario**

1. **System Failure Detection**: If the Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System detects a failure (e.g., malfunctioning sensors or deactivated features), the vehicle will notify the user via visual or audible warnings.
2. **Manual Override**: In the event of system failure, the user can manually trigger the evacuation process using a dedicated emergency button inside the vehicle or through a mobile app.
3. **Manual Door Unlocking**: If the doors fail to unlock automatically, the user can manually open them or use the emergency exit lever located near the door handles.
4. **Lack of Emergency Lighting**: If the emergency lighting system fails, the vehicle's hazard lights will activate as a secondary measure to help users navigate.
5. **Guidance via Mobile App**: If in-vehicle assistance is unavailable, the user can receive evacuation guidance through the mobile app connected to the vehicle, providing step-by-step instructions.

**Postconditions**

- After the successful interaction with the Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System, the vehicle’s occupants have safely evacuated the vehicle.
- The system logs the evacuation event for further analysis, including data on the failure or success of different system components (if any).
- The vehicle may automatically notify emergency services (if enabled) to provide immediate assistance to the occupants.
- The system resets to normal operation once the evacuation is completed, ready for future use.
