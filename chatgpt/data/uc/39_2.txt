**Title:**  
Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System

**Goal:**  
The Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System is designed to enhance the safety of luxury electric vehicles by providing real-time detection of potential collision threats and warning the driver to take necessary actions. The system continuously monitors the environment around the vehicle using advanced sensors and algorithms to predict and prevent accidents. If a collision risk is detected, the system will alert the driver through visual, auditory, or haptic warnings, and, in certain cases, will automatically engage safety measures such as emergency braking or evasive steering to avoid the collision.

**Preconditions:**  
- The vehicle is equipped with the necessary hardware, including cameras, radar sensors, and LIDAR, for the real-time monitoring of surrounding objects.
- The vehicle's software has been calibrated and is fully functional.
- The driver has activated the system by turning on the vehicle's collision avoidance feature through the vehicle’s infotainment menu or dashboard controls.
- The system is operational and has been validated for the specific vehicle model.

**Main Scenario:**  
1. **Driver Action:** Alise starts the vehicle and activates the Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System using the infotainment screen.  
   **System Response:** The system initializes, running a self-check to ensure all sensors are operational.

2. **Driver Action:** Alise begins driving, and the system continuously monitors the surrounding environment for potential hazards such as other vehicles, pedestrians, or obstacles.  
   **System Response:** The system detects objects within a predefined radius and starts analyzing possible collision risks based on speed and trajectory.

3. **Driver Action:** A pedestrian suddenly steps into the path of the vehicle.  
   **System Response:** The system detects the pedestrian and calculates the risk of collision, issuing an auditory and visual warning to Alise, such as a flashing light on the dashboard and a warning sound.

4. **Driver Action:** Alise applies the brakes in response to the warning.  
   **System Response:** If the risk of collision is imminent, the system automatically activates the emergency braking function to reduce the vehicle’s speed and avoid impact.

5. **Driver Action:** After the warning or intervention, Alise regains control, and the vehicle continues driving.  
   **System Response:** The system resets and resumes normal operation, continuing to monitor for new collision risks.

**Alternative Scenario:**  
1. **Driver Action:** Bob starts the vehicle, but the system fails to initialize correctly due to a sensor malfunction.  
   **System Response:** The system displays an error message on the dashboard, informing Bob that the collision avoidance system is unavailable due to sensor failure.

2. **Driver Action:** Bob continues driving, unaware that the system is not functioning.  
   **System Response:** The vehicle operates without real-time collision detection, and the vehicle will not provide any collision alerts or automatic interventions.

3. **Driver Action:** Bob pulls over and contacts the service center to report the malfunction.  
   **System Response:** The system logs the error, and the vehicle's software will be analyzed and repaired to restore the collision avoidance feature.

**Postconditions:**  
After a successful interaction with the Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System, the driver is alerted to potential collision risks, allowing them to take appropriate action to avoid an accident. If the system detects a high-risk situation, it may take automatic control of the vehicle to mitigate or prevent the collision. Following a successful intervention, the system returns to its regular monitoring mode, ensuring the vehicle remains safe for continued operation.
