**Title:** Emergency Roadside Assistance Integration

**Goal:**  
The Emergency Roadside Assistance Integration will provide users with a seamless and efficient way to request immediate assistance in the event of a breakdown or emergency while on the road. The system will automatically connect the user to a professional roadside assistance service, enabling a swift resolution to issues such as flat tires, battery problems, fuel shortages, or other emergency situations.

**Preconditions:**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary hardware and software to support the Emergency Roadside Assistance Integration.
- The user must have an active subscription or access to the emergency roadside service provider.
- The vehicle must be connected to a cellular network or Wi-Fi to communicate with the roadside assistance provider.
- The user must be within the coverage area of the assistance service provider.

**Main Scenario:**  
1. Alise, while driving, experiences a flat tire and realizes she needs emergency roadside assistance.  
2. Alise presses the "Roadside Assistance" button on the car’s touchscreen interface.  
3. The system verifies Alise’s location and communicates with the service provider to confirm availability.  
4. The system displays an estimated time of arrival for the roadside assistance team and notifies Alise.  
5. The emergency services team arrives at the specified location and provides assistance, such as changing the tire or jump-starting the car.

**Alternative Scenario:**  
1. Bob, driving through a remote area, experiences a battery failure and presses the "Roadside Assistance" button.  
2. The system attempts to connect to the service provider but fails due to a lack of cellular signal.  
3. The system notifies Bob that no connection could be established, and suggests he try again after moving to a location with better network coverage.  
4. If no coverage is available, Bob is prompted with a list of emergency instructions, such as calling for a tow service manually or using a local emergency number.  
5. Bob proceeds by following the instructions, and the system records the event for future improvement.

**Postconditions:**  
- After a successful interaction, Alise’s vehicle will have received the necessary roadside assistance, and the system will log the event, updating the vehicle’s status as "Resolved" or "Assisted."  
- Bob, in case of network failure, will have the option to either wait for service recovery or manually seek help, with the system saving the session details for troubleshooting.
