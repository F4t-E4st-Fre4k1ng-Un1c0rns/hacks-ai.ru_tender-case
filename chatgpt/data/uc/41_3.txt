**Underpinning Contract for Setting Geofences for Vehicle Tracking and Monitoring**

**1. Title**  
Setting Geofences for Vehicle Tracking and Monitoring

**2. Goal**  
The goal of the "Setting Geofences for Vehicle Tracking and Monitoring" sub-System is to enable users to define geographic boundaries or zones for vehicle tracking. This feature allows the company to monitor the location of luxury electric vehicles in real-time, track their entry or exit from pre-defined areas, and enhance security and fleet management. The system will provide real-time notifications when a vehicle crosses the geofence boundaries, giving the user better control over vehicle movements and location data.

**3. Preconditions**  
- The user must have administrative access to the system.
- The user must have a valid account in the system and be logged in.
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary tracking hardware and have an active GPS connection.
- The user must have a basic understanding of geographic coordinates and mapping tools.
- The sub-System should be properly integrated with the vehicle's tracking system.

**4. Main Scenario**  
1. The user (Bob) logs into the vehicle tracking platform using their credentials.  
2. Bob selects the "Geofence Management" option from the main menu.  
3. Bob defines the geographic boundaries for the geofence by either selecting a pre-set zone from the map or manually inputting the coordinates.  
4. Bob saves the geofence configuration and assigns it to the specific vehicle(s) he wishes to monitor.  
5. The system confirms the successful creation of the geofence and begins real-time tracking of the vehicle’s location in relation to the geofence.

**5. Alternative Scenario**  
- **Scenario 1: Geofence creation fails due to invalid coordinates**  
   1. Bob attempts to define the geofence area but enters invalid or unreachable coordinates.  
   2. The system alerts Bob with a message: "Invalid coordinates. Please check the input."  
   3. Bob is prompted to correct the coordinates and try again.  

- **Scenario 2: GPS signal loss**  
   1. Bob sets a geofence, but the vehicle temporarily loses its GPS connection.  
   2. The system notifies Bob with a warning: "GPS signal lost. Geofence tracking is temporarily unavailable."  
   3. Once the GPS signal is restored, the system automatically resumes geofence monitoring and notifies Bob of the restoration.

**6. Postconditions**  
- After a successful interaction with the sub-System, the user will have a geofence actively monitoring the designated vehicle(s).  
- The system will send real-time notifications to the user whenever the vehicle enters or exits the defined geofence boundaries.  
- The user can view the vehicle's location on the map and track its movements in relation to the geofence at any time.
