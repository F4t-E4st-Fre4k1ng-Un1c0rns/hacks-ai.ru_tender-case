**Title:**
Automated Navigation Re-routing Based on Traffic Conditions

**Goal:**
The Automated Navigation Re-routing Based on Traffic Conditions sub-System aims to enhance the driving experience by dynamically adjusting the navigation route of the luxury electric car in response to real-time traffic data. This sub-system will provide the user with optimized routes, ensuring a more efficient and time-saving journey by avoiding congested areas, accidents, or road closures. The system will automatically evaluate traffic conditions and suggest the best alternative route based on user preferences or predefined settings.

**Preconditions:**
1. The luxury electric car is equipped with the necessary hardware, including GPS, real-time traffic data integration, and navigation software.
2. The user has enabled the automated navigation re-routing feature within the car's infotainment or navigation system.
3. A stable internet connection is available to receive live traffic updates.
4. The user has set the destination and selected preferences such as fastest or most scenic route.
5. The car's navigation system is functioning correctly, and traffic data from external sources is up-to-date.

**Main Scenario:**
1. Alise enters the desired destination into the navigation system of the car.
2. The sub-system processes the current traffic conditions and identifies the best route to reach the destination.
3. While driving, the system detects traffic congestion ahead, such as a traffic jam or road blockage.
4. The system automatically calculates alternative routes in real time and presents the best available option to Alise on the navigation screen.
5. Alise accepts the suggested re-route, and the navigation system guides her along the new path, keeping her informed of any further changes in traffic conditions.

**Alternative Scenario:**
1. Bob enters the destination into the navigation system, but due to a lack of real-time traffic data (e.g., poor internet connection or data feed failure), the system cannot access the necessary information.
2. The sub-system notifies Bob of the issue with a message indicating that traffic updates are unavailable at the moment.
3. Bob is given the option to manually adjust the route or continue on the original path.
4. The system will continue to guide Bob based on the available map data, but without real-time traffic re-routing assistance.
5. Once the system regains access to traffic data, it will resume monitoring traffic conditions and suggest new routes as necessary.

**Postconditions:**
After a successful interaction with the sub-system, the luxury electric car's navigation system has adjusted the driving route to reflect current traffic conditions. Alise or Bob is directed along a more efficient route, potentially saving time and avoiding traffic-related delays. The system continues to monitor traffic conditions throughout the journey, automatically re-routing if new traffic issues arise, ensuring a smooth and optimized driving experience.
