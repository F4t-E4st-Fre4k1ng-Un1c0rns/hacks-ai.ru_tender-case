### 2. Goal  
The goal of the In-Vehicle Cloud Storage for Personal Data and Music is to provide the user with seamless access to their personal data, music collection, and related content directly from the vehicle’s infotainment system. This subsystem will allow the user to upload, store, and retrieve personal data, including music playlists, preferences, contacts, and vehicle settings. It will ensure a secure, accessible, and personalized experience while driving. The cloud storage will be fully integrated with the vehicle's system, allowing for automatic synchronization and real-time access across all connected devices.
