**4. Main Scenario**  
1. **User Action**: Alise enters a toll road or approaches a parking facility.  
   **Sub-System Response**: The In-Car Payment System automatically detects the toll or parking entry and displays payment options on the vehicle's infotainment screen.

2. **User Action**: Alise selects the preferred payment method displayed on the screen.

3. **User Action**: Alise confirms the payment and drives through the toll or parks the car in the parking area.  
   **Sub-System Response**: The system sends a payment confirmation to the toll or parking system, allowing the barrier to lift or granting access to the parking area.

4. **User Action**: Alise continues driving or parks the car.  
   **Sub-System Response**: The system records the payment and provides an option to receive a digital receipt or send it to the user’s email.

  1. **User Action**: Bob approaches a toll or parking area and attempts to use the in-car payment system.  
     **Sub-System Response**: The system fails to detect the toll or parking system due to connectivity issues or incompatibility with the external payment infrastructure.  
  2. **User Action**: Bob manually selects a backup payment option or exits the payment screen.  
     **Sub-System Response**: The system offers an alternative payment method (e.g., using a smartphone app or physical payment at a toll booth or parking meter).  
  3. **User Action**: Bob proceeds with the manual payment option.  
     **Sub-System Response**: The system logs the error and notifies Bob that the payment was not processed through the in-car system but that the manual payment is accepted.

     **Sub-System Response**: The system notifies Bob that the payment system is unavailable and provides an option to pay manually.  
  2. **User Action**: Bob exits the payment interface and proceeds to a manual payment option.
