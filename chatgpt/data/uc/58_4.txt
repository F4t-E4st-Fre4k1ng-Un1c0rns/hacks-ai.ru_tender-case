**Title:**  
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication Integration

**Goal:**  
The Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication Integration will enable seamless communication between the luxury electric car and the surrounding infrastructure, such as traffic lights, road signs, parking systems, and charging stations. This will enhance the driving experience by providing real-time updates and feedback to the user. The sub-system will improve traffic flow, enable predictive maintenance notifications, and assist with energy management by optimizing charging schedules and route planning.

**Preconditions:**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary V2I communication hardware (e.g., antennas, sensors, and communication interfaces).
- The vehicle must be within range of compatible infrastructure (e.g., smart traffic lights, connected charging stations).
- The infrastructure components must support V2I communication protocols.
- The vehicle’s software must be updated to include V2I communication capabilities.
- The user must have a user profile linked to the vehicle’s system for personalized services.

**Main Scenario:**  
1. **User enters the vehicle**: Bob starts his luxury electric car and activates the V2I system by engaging the vehicle’s interface (touchscreen or voice command).  
2. **Vehicle connects to nearby infrastructure**: The system scans for available V2I-enabled infrastructure such as nearby charging stations and smart traffic lights.  
3. **Real-time information provided to user**: The system displays available parking spots, optimal charging stations along the user’s route, and live traffic signal statuses. Bob receives suggestions for route optimization based on the traffic light timings and potential charging needs.  
4. **User receives system alerts and updates**: As Bob drives, the system communicates with traffic lights to adjust signal timings in his favor, reducing wait times. Bob is also notified of upcoming traffic events and can plan accordingly.  
5. **User confirmation and action**: Bob confirms an optimal charging stop suggested by the system, and the vehicle automatically begins route adjustments to lead him to the selected charging station.

**Alternative Scenario:**  
1. **User enters the vehicle**: Bob activates the V2I system, but the vehicle fails to connect to nearby infrastructure.  
2. **Error notification**: The system alerts Bob that the V2I system cannot find compatible infrastructure or the network is unavailable.  
3. **User is given alternatives**: Bob receives a list of fallback options, such as driving to a known location with available infrastructure (e.g., public charging stations or manually selecting routes without V2I enhancements).  
4. **Manual adjustments**: Bob can manually adjust his route using traditional navigation or opt for energy-saving recommendations based on current battery levels.  
5. **Reattempt or resolve**: Bob is encouraged to reattempt the connection once the system detects better infrastructure coverage or the issue is resolved by vehicle diagnostics.

**Postconditions:**  
- Upon successful interaction with the V2I system, Bob will have received real-time updates on traffic, optimized routing, and an integrated charging schedule that adjusts according to his driving patterns and infrastructure availability.  
- The system ensures that Bob’s journey is enhanced with reduced wait times at traffic lights and efficient energy management through charging station integration.  
- The V2I communication also provides maintenance updates based on infrastructure feedback, such as roadwork or accidents in the vicinity, improving the overall driving experience.
