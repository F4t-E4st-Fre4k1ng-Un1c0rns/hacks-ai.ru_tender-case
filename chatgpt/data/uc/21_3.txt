**Underpinning Contract: Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control**

**1. Title:**
Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control

**2. Goal:**
The Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control sub-system provides the ability to seamlessly and securely identify drivers based on unique identifiers (e.g., facial recognition, fingerprint, or keycard), and control access to the vehicle. It ensures that only authorized users can start or operate the vehicle, enhancing security and convenience for both the driver and the manufacturer. This system prevents unauthorized use and streamlines the process of driver authentication.

**3. Preconditions:**
- The sub-system must be integrated into the luxury electric vehicle’s onboard systems and hardware.
- The vehicle must have the necessary hardware for biometric recognition (e.g., cameras for facial recognition, fingerprint sensors, or access card readers).
- The driver’s identification data must be registered in the system prior to usage.
- The system must be activated and calibrated during the vehicle's setup, with the driver’s unique data securely stored.
- The vehicle must be in "Ready" mode for authentication to proceed.

**4. Main Scenario:**
1. The driver approaches the vehicle and the sub-system detects the presence of an authorized user via proximity sensors.
2. The sub-system prompts the driver to present their identification method (e.g., facial scan, fingerprint, or access card).
3. The driver either faces the camera for facial recognition, places their finger on the sensor, or swipes their access card.
4. The sub-system processes the identification data and compares it to the stored records for verification.
5. Upon successful identification, the sub-system unlocks the vehicle, grants access, and enables the driver to start the vehicle.

**5. Alternative Scenario:**
1. The driver approaches the vehicle, but the sub-system fails to detect the authorized user due to an issue with proximity sensors or a hardware malfunction.
2. The sub-system alerts the driver with a message, requesting them to manually enter their backup identification method, such as a PIN code or mobile app verification.
3. If the manual method fails, the system sends a notification to the vehicle’s support team for further troubleshooting or to remotely unlock the vehicle.
4. The system provides an option for the driver to contact customer support directly if the issue persists.

**6. Postconditions:**
- The vehicle is successfully unlocked, and the driver has gained access to operate the vehicle.
- All actions related to the identification process are logged for security and auditing purposes.
- The driver is granted full access to the vehicle and can begin operation without further authentication, unless a new session requires identification.
