**Underpinning Contract: User Preferences Management for Infotainment System**

1. **Goal**  
   The User Preferences Management for Infotainment System will provide the user with the ability to customize and manage personal settings related to the infotainment system in a luxury electric car. This includes configuring preferences such as preferred audio settings, display options, seat positions, climate control settings, and navigation routes. The system will enhance the user experience by remembering these preferences across multiple sessions and providing personalized interactions based on user history.

2. **Preconditions**  
   - The user has successfully logged into the infotainment system using a personal profile (e.g., user account with a unique identifier).
   - The user has connected their smartphone or other devices to the infotainment system, if required.
   - The car’s infotainment system is powered on and fully operational.
   - The system is integrated with other vehicle systems (e.g., climate control, seating, audio).
   - The user has the necessary permissions to modify preferences.

3. **Main Scenario**  
   1. The user, Alice, enters the vehicle and starts the infotainment system.
   2. Alice accesses the "User Preferences" menu on the infotainment screen.
   3. Alice selects the settings she wants to adjust, such as seat position, audio volume, and navigation preferences.
   4. Alice confirms the changes and saves them to her profile.
   5. The system updates her profile with the new preferences and provides feedback confirming that the preferences have been saved successfully.

4. **Alternative Scenario**  
   - If the user, Bob, encounters a situation where the infotainment system fails to load his preferences:
     1. Bob enters the vehicle and powers on the infotainment system.
     2. The system prompts him with an error message indicating that the user preferences could not be loaded due to a technical issue.
     3. Bob selects the "Retry" option to attempt loading his preferences again.
     4. If the issue persists, Bob is provided with the option to manually configure basic settings (such as audio volume and seat position) without accessing personalized preferences.
     5. The system logs the failure and alerts the support team for further investigation, while Bob continues using the system with default settings until the issue is resolved.

5. **Postconditions**  
   - Upon successful interaction, Alice’s personalized preferences are saved and applied to her profile, ensuring that all future interactions with the infotainment system will reflect her custom settings (e.g., audio, seat position, navigation). The system will automatically apply these preferences each time Alice uses the vehicle, providing a seamless and personalized driving experience.
