1. **Title**  
   User Preferences Management for Infotainment System

2. **Goal**  
   The User Preferences Management sub-system is designed to allow users to customize their infotainment experience in the luxury electric vehicle. It will provide features that enable users to personalize settings such as audio preferences, climate control settings, display themes, and other infotainment options. This sub-system aims to ensure a seamless, intuitive user experience that adapts to the individual needs and preferences of the driver and passengers.

3. **Preconditions**  
   - The vehicle must be powered on and the infotainment system must be active.
   - The user must have a user profile set up or be able to create one.
   - The system should be connected to the vehicle's central computing unit and other relevant modules.
   - The user must have access to the infotainment interface, either through a touchscreen, voice commands, or physical controls, depending on the vehicle's configuration.
   - The system must be properly calibrated to recognize user inputs and preferences.

4. **Main Scenario**  
   1. The user, Alise, enters the vehicle and starts the infotainment system using either the voice command "Activate Infotainment" or by pressing the screen.
   2. Alise accesses the "Preferences" menu through the main interface, either by selecting it from the touchscreen menu or using the voice command "Open Preferences."
   3. Alise selects the specific category she wishes to modify, such as "Audio," "Climate," or "Display," and adjusts the settings as desired, such as changing the music volume, preferred temperature, or screen brightness.
   4. The system immediately saves Alise's changes and confirms the adjustments with a visual or auditory cue, such as a confirmation message on the screen or a brief voice response like, "Your preferences have been updated."
   5. Alise exits the preferences menu, and the system continues to apply the changes as she drives, ensuring the settings are retained for future use.

5. **Alternative Scenario**  
   1. Bob enters the vehicle and attempts to adjust the preferences using the infotainment system.
   2. The system fails to load the "Preferences" menu due to a temporary software issue or connectivity problem.
   3. A message appears on the screen or a voice prompt informs Bob: "Preferences menu is unavailable at the moment. Please try again later."
   4. Bob attempts to access the preferences again after a brief wait, or chooses alternative means of adjusting preferences, such as manual controls (if available) or using voice commands for basic changes.
   5. If the issue persists, Bob is directed to contact customer support for further assistance.

6. **Postconditions**  
   After successfully interacting with the User Preferences Management sub-system, the following results are achieved:  
   - Alise’s or Bob’s personalized settings are saved and applied, ensuring that the infotainment system adjusts to their preferred audio, climate, display, and other system configurations.
   - The system confirms that the new preferences have been successfully stored, ensuring a tailored and comfortable experience for the user.
   - The personalized settings are retained for future use, so the user does not need to reconfigure them each time they use the vehicle.
