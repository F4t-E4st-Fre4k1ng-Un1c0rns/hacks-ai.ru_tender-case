Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System (EEES) – Technical Specifications

**Functional Description**  
The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System (EEES) is designed to ensure the rapid and safe evacuation of occupants from the vehicle in the event of an emergency, including collisions, fires, or water submersion. The system features automated door unlocking, seat release, emergency lighting, and audio guidance to direct passengers to the nearest exit. The EEES provides a reliable, clear, and efficient means of evacuation under a variety of critical conditions, enhancing passenger safety during emergencies.

**Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be operational with all necessary sensors (impact, fire, water detection) and power systems functioning.
- All vehicle seats must be occupied, and doors must be securely locked.
- Emergency conditions must be detected, such as an accident, fire, or water submersion.
- The EEES must be in an active state with operational sensors and power.

**Trigger Conditions**  
- A collision or sudden impact detected by the vehicle's impact sensors.
- The presence of smoke, fire, or excessive heat detected by fire sensors.
- Water submersion or rapid cabin flooding detected.
- Manual activation of the system by the driver or emergency responder.
- Sudden loss of cabin pressure or extreme temperature change detected.

**Execution Output**  
- Automated unlocking of all vehicle doors to allow for egress.
- Release of all seat locks to facilitate quick evacuation.
- Activation of emergency lighting along the evacuation path, guiding occupants to the nearest exit.
- Activation of audible guidance prompts to provide clear directions for evacuation.
- Continuous monitoring to confirm that all exits are open and all passengers have safely evacuated.

**Exit Conditions**  
- The system shuts down once all passengers have exited the vehicle and are confirmed to be at a safe distance.
- The vehicle’s emergency systems deactivate after the evacuation is complete.
- Data related to the emergency event is automatically logged in the vehicle's incident record for further review.
- The system transitions into a standby mode, awaiting a reset or inspection before reactivation.
