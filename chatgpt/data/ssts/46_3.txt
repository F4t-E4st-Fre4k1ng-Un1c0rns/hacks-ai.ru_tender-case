**Technical Specifications: Automatic Synchronization of Vehicle Settings across Multiple Devices**

### 1. Title
**Automatic Synchronization of Vehicle Settings across Multiple Devices**

### 2. Functional Description
The sub-system facilitates the automatic synchronization of vehicle settings (such as seat position, mirror adjustments, climate control preferences, and driving modes) across multiple user devices, including smartphones, tablets, and in-vehicle systems. When a setting is changed on any device, the sub-system synchronizes these changes across all connected devices in real-time or near real-time, ensuring the user experiences consistent settings regardless of the platform being used. The system supports seamless device switching and synchronization, while maintaining device compatibility and reliable performance under typical network conditions.

### 3. Enabling Conditions
- The vehicle’s infotainment system must support wireless connectivity, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular data.
- The user must have an active and authenticated account with the vehicle's ecosystem, registered on all devices (smartphones, tablets, in-vehicle system) they wish to synchronize.
- At least one personalized vehicle setting (seat position, climate control, driving mode, etc.) must have been customized by the user.
- All devices must be connected to a stable network and be within range of the vehicle for synchronization to occur.

### 4. Trigger Conditions
- A change in vehicle settings (e.g., seat adjustment, driving mode, or mirror positioning) initiated from any connected device.
- Addition or removal of a device from the user’s account or synchronization list.
- Device re-connection after a network or connection failure.
- The user logs into a new device or reconfigures settings on an existing device that requires synchronization with other devices.

### 5. Execution Output
- **Successful Synchronization:** Upon a successful change in settings from any device, the sub-system synchronizes the updated settings across all connected devices in real time, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **Delayed Synchronization:** If network conditions or multiple simultaneous changes delay synchronization, the system will still eventually sync all devices with the latest settings, ensuring that the most recent configuration is reflected on every device.
- **Error Notification:** If synchronization fails due to connectivity issues or other technical problems, the system will display an error message. The message will include information on the issue (e.g., “Network Connection Lost”) and prompt the user to take corrective action, such as reconnecting to the vehicle’s system or checking network status.

### 6. Exit Conditions
- **Successful Exit:** Once synchronization is completed successfully and the settings have been updated on all devices, the system exits the synchronization process, and the user is notified that all devices are in sync.
- **Failure to Sync:** If synchronization cannot be completed due to persistent issues (e.g., network failure or device compatibility problems), the system will notify the user and exit the process after a defined time limit. The system will offer guidance on resolving the issue (e.g., reconnecting devices or checking network connections) and prompt the user to try again once the issue is resolved.

**Summary of Compliance Adjustments:**
- Real-time synchronization is prioritized but may experience delays under certain network conditions, addressing the partially compliant nature of the system.
- Error messages are detailed with specific guidance to help the user resolve any issues that arise, improving user experience during failures.
- Synchronization will occur across all devices, but simultaneous changes may result in temporary delays; however, the system ensures eventual consistency.
