**Technical Specifications for Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control**

**1. Title**  
Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control - Technical Specifications

**2. Functional Description**  
The Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control sub-System provides seamless and secure access to the vehicle by identifying the authorized driver using biometric data (such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning) and secure access credentials (e.g., key fob or PIN). Once authenticated, the system grants access to the vehicle by unlocking the doors, and it adjusts the vehicle’s settings (e.g., seat position, mirror angles, climate control) based on the driver's preferences. In the event of a failed authentication, the system provides alternative methods for driver verification and ensures all access events are logged for security purposes.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with compatible biometric sensors (e.g., cameras, fingerprint scanners) or a secure access device (e.g., key fob or Bluetooth for keyless entry).  
- The driver’s biometric data or credentials must be registered in the vehicle's secure system for identification purposes.  
- The vehicle must be equipped with updated software that integrates the Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control sub-System.  
- The system requires a reliable connection between the sensors, access control module, and the vehicle's internal electronics.  
- Driver profiles must be created and stored within the system, including personalized settings such as seat position and climate preferences.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- A driver approaches the vehicle with a registered access credential (such as a registered face, fingerprint, or key fob).  
- The system is activated upon detecting the proximity of the driver or interaction with the access control device.  
- The system initiates authentication based on the input from the biometric sensor or access device.  
- The vehicle is in a locked state when the driver attempts to gain access.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Upon successful authentication, the system unlocks the vehicle’s doors, granting access to the driver.  
- The system logs the access event, recording the driver’s identity, the time of access, and other relevant details.  
- The vehicle automatically adjusts personalized settings based on the driver’s pre-registered profile (e.g., adjusting the seat, mirrors, and climate controls).  
- If authentication fails, the vehicle remains locked, and an error message is generated, prompting the driver to retry or use an alternative authentication method.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system successfully authenticates the driver, unlocks the vehicle doors, and adjusts the settings to the driver’s preferences.  
- The system logs the access event and successfully exits the authentication process.  
- In the event of failure, the system remains in a locked state, and a failure notification is generated, indicating the reason for authentication failure (e.g., sensor malfunction or incorrect credential).  
- If multiple failed attempts occur, the system will exit the process and prompt the driver for a backup authentication method or manual override.
