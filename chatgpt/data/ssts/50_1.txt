**Technical Specifications: Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface**

### 1. Title
**Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface**

### 2. Functional Description
The Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface provides an automated, seamless method for users to manage parking payments directly through their vehicle's interface. The system detects when a vehicle enters and exits a designated parking area, calculates the parking fee based on the duration of the session, and allows the user to process the payment via the vehicle's integrated infotainment system. The payment can be made using linked credit/debit cards, parking accounts, or other supported payment methods. The system provides feedback to both the user and the parking facility on the transaction status, including session start, fee calculation, payment processing, and confirmation.

### 3. Enabling Conditions
- **Active Vehicle Interface:** The vehicle must be equipped with a functioning infotainment system capable of supporting the payment interface.
- **Supported Parking Facility:** The parking facility must be integrated with the Automatic Parking Payment System, including sensor-based entry detection, parking space recognition, and payment gateway compatibility.
- **Linked Payment Method:** The vehicle must have a valid, active payment method associated with it (e.g., credit card, parking account, mobile payment integration).
- **Internet Connectivity:** A stable and active internet connection is required for real-time communication with the payment gateway and parking facility systems.
- **User Permissions:** The user must grant the necessary permissions for the system to access and process parking session and payment information.

### 4. Trigger Conditions
- **Vehicle Entry Detection:** The system detects when the vehicle enters a supported parking facility, initiating the start of the parking session.
- **Parking Session Start:** When the vehicle stops in a valid parking space, the system recognizes the session start through sensor or GPS data.
- **Payment Request:** When the user accesses the vehicle's interface upon returning, the system triggers the payment screen displaying session details and calculated fees.
- **Payment Confirmation:** After user confirmation, the system initiates the payment process and communicates with the payment gateway for real-time transaction approval.

### 5. Execution Output
- **Parking Session Confirmation:** A notification is displayed on the vehicle interface confirming the start of the parking session, along with relevant parking details (e.g., parking space, time entered).
- **Real-Time Fee Calculation:** The system calculates the parking fee based on the duration of the session and presents it to the user via the interface.
- **Payment Processing:** The system processes the payment through the linked payment method, providing real-time updates on transaction status.
- **Payment Receipt:** Upon successful payment, the system generates a payment receipt which can be saved or sent to the user through email or alternative notification methods.
- **Parking Facility Notification:** Once the payment is processed, the parking facility receives a transaction confirmation, closing the parking session and releasing the space for other users.

### 6. Exit Conditions
- **Successful Payment:** The parking session is completed once payment is successfully processed. The system closes the session, and the user receives confirmation on the vehicle interface or through other means.
- **Payment Failure:** If the payment is unsuccessful (e.g., invalid payment method, insufficient funds), the system notifies the user and provides options for alternative payment methods (e.g., kiosk, mobile app).
- **System Malfunction or Error:** If there is an error in detecting the vehicle’s entry, processing the payment, or any other failure, the system prompts the user to manually input session details or resolve the issue through alternative means.
- **Manual Intervention:** In cases where automatic detection fails, the user may need to manually enter parking details or use an alternative method to complete the payment.
