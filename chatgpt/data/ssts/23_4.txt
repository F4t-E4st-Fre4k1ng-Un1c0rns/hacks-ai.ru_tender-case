Technical Specifications for the Integration of Social Media Platforms into Infotainment

**Functional Description:**  
The subsystem enables users to access and interact with their social media platforms through the vehicle’s infotainment system. It supports popular platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Users can view their social media feeds, interact with posts (like, share, comment), and receive notifications of new interactions (messages, likes, comments). Voice commands are used for hands-free interaction, including responding to posts or comments. The system ensures a non-distracting interface to provide a seamless integration with the vehicle’s infotainment environment.

**Enabling Conditions:**  
- The vehicle’s infotainment system must be connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or mobile data to facilitate social media access.
- Users must have active accounts on compatible social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) and grant the necessary permissions to integrate these accounts with the infotainment system.
- The system must be equipped with voice recognition, touch-screen functionality, and a stable internet connection.
- The user must enable social media integration in the infotainment settings, including granting the app access to personal data required for interaction (e.g., posts, messages).
- The vehicle must support the latest software updates to ensure compatibility with social media platforms.

**Trigger Conditions:**  
- User selects the "Social Media" menu option on the infotainment system's interface.
- User connects the vehicle’s infotainment system to the internet via Wi-Fi or mobile data.
- User logs in to their social media account through the infotainment system, allowing the system to retrieve the user’s feed and notifications.
- User grants the necessary permissions for the system to interact with social media platforms, including viewing content, posting updates, and accessing messages.

**Execution Output:**  
- The system will display a list of available social media platforms once the user selects the "Social Media" option.
- Upon selecting a platform (e.g., Instagram, Facebook), the system will retrieve and display the user’s most recent feed in a simplified, non-distracting format.
- The user can view posts, scroll through the feed, and interact by liking, commenting, or sharing posts.
- Notifications for new interactions (comments, likes, messages) will be displayed, allowing the user to respond to them in real-time via voice commands or touch interface.
- If the user decides to post content, the system will allow text input, voice-to-text functionality for comments or messages, and media uploads from the vehicle’s interface.
- The system will confirm actions, such as post submissions or comment replies, with a feedback notification on the screen.

**Exit Conditions:**  
- The user can exit the social media interface by selecting the "Close" button or returning to the main infotainment screen, which ends the session and closes any active social media platform.
- User logs out of the social media platform, either manually or after a specified time of inactivity, ensuring no data is left open.
- The system will automatically terminate any social media session if the internet connection is lost or becomes unavailable, displaying a message indicating the connection issue and allowing the user to retry or return to the main menu.
- After interaction, the system will ensure that all active sessions are securely closed, and no residual data (such as unread messages or unsent posts) is left open.
