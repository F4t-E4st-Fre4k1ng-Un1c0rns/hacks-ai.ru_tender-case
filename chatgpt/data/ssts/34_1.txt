2. **Functional Description**  
   The Integration of Third-Party Apps into the Car Infotainment System allows users to seamlessly connect and interact with third-party applications such as navigation, music streaming, communication, and entertainment platforms. The system provides a safe and intuitive interface through the car’s infotainment system, offering features like app launching, control through voice commands, touchscreen, or steering wheel buttons, and displaying app information on the car's display. The integration ensures a smooth user experience without compromising safety while driving.

   - A stable internet connection must be available either through the vehicle's built-in data connection or a mobile hotspot.
   - The infotainment system must be running the latest software version that supports the third-party app integration feature.
   - The user must grant necessary permissions to the infotainment system, such as Bluetooth or data access, to enable app integration.

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - The vehicle is powered on, and the infotainment system activates.
   - The user connects their device to the car’s infotainment system via Bluetooth, USB, or Wi-Fi.
   - The system detects compatible third-party apps installed on the connected device.
   - The user selects a third-party app through the infotainment system interface using touch controls, voice commands, or steering wheel buttons.
   - The system confirms that the app is ready for use and displays it on the infotainment screen.

5. **Execution Output**  
   - Once triggered, the selected third-party app will be launched and displayed on the infotainment screen.
   - The app’s functionality (e.g., navigation directions, music playlists, messaging) will be fully accessible through the infotainment interface, including control options via touchscreen, voice, or steering wheel.
   - The system will continue to allow interaction with the app as long as the app is active, ensuring that user actions (e.g., entering a destination, changing music) are executed correctly.
   - In the event of any issue (e.g., connectivity loss), the system will alert the user with a notification on the infotainment screen.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - The user exits the app by either selecting the “exit” function on the infotainment screen or using voice commands.
   - The system will return to the main infotainment menu or the previous screen after the app is closed.
   - In the event of a connectivity issue, the app will pause or close, and the system will display a message indicating the error, such as “Connection lost” or “App unavailable.”
   - Once the user disconnects their device or the system is turned off, the app session will end, and the system will reset or return to a default state.
