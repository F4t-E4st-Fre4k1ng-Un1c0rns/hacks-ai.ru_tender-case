Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System - Technical Specifications

**1. Functional Description**  
The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System (DBMFS) is designed to monitor, analyze, and provide real-time feedback on a driver's behavior during vehicle operation. The system tracks key performance indicators, including speed, acceleration, braking, and cornering. It offers personalized suggestions, such as "Gentle braking recommended" or "Reduce acceleration," to improve driving habits. In addition, it provides visual and auditory alerts for unsafe behavior, encourages eco-driving, and compiles a detailed report at the end of each trip with insights on the driver's performance.

**2. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with sensors such as an accelerometer, speedometer, and gyroscope for accurate behavior tracking.
- The system requires a driver profile to be set up in the vehicle’s onboard system, ensuring personalized data and feedback.
- The system must be activated automatically when the vehicle ignition is turned on, with the vehicle entering the driving mode.
- Secure data transmission and storage must be enabled, ensuring compliance with privacy and security regulations.
- The system must be capable of functioning continuously throughout the driving trip, ensuring uninterrupted operation unless a fault occurs.

**3. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is triggered automatically when the vehicle is started (ignition on) or when a new trip begins, registering the start of the trip.
- It activates upon detection of key driving events such as acceleration, braking, sharp turns, or speeding, ensuring real-time feedback for unsafe or non-optimal behavior.
- If a system error is detected during initialization or during the trip, a diagnostic alert will be triggered to notify the driver.

**4. Execution Output**  
- Real-time visual and auditory alerts will be displayed on the dashboard to indicate safe and unsafe driving behaviors.
- Personalized feedback will be provided, such as specific recommendations for improved driving, including but not limited to: "Gentle braking recommended," "Slow down," or "Maintain steady acceleration."
- A trip summary report will be generated at the end of each driving session, providing insights into the driver’s behavior, highlighting areas for improvement, and offering eco-driving suggestions.
- The system will store driving data securely, making it available for the driver’s review in future trips or via a connected mobile application.

**5. Exit Conditions**  
- The system exits real-time feedback mode when the vehicle ignition is turned off.
- If a system failure occurs, a notification will alert the driver, and the system will enter maintenance mode, ceasing normal feedback functions until the issue is resolved.
- Upon trip completion, the system generates a final trip report, stores data securely, and transitions to standby mode, awaiting the next trip.
- If the vehicle remains idle for an extended period (e.g., over 24 hours), the system may automatically deactivate to save energy but will remain in standby mode, ready to activate upon the next driving session.
