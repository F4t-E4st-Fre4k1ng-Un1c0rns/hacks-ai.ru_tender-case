**1. Title**  
Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization

**2. Functional description**  
The Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization allows users to personalize the adaptive cruise control system’s settings for their preferred driving style and conditions. It provides control over parameters such as following distance, speed limit preferences, and driving modes (relaxed, standard, or aggressive). The system must interpret user inputs and adjust the vehicle’s behavior to ensure safe and efficient driving in various road conditions. This feature operates in conjunction with the vehicle’s sensors, control algorithms, and environmental awareness to adapt the cruise control to the user’s custom settings.

**3. Enabling conditions**  
- The vehicle must be powered on, with the engine running and functional.
- The Adaptive Cruise Control system must be activated and operational within the vehicle’s control panel or infotainment system.
- The system must be in a non-error state with no malfunction notifications (e.g., sensor failure, software error).
- The customization menu must be accessible via the vehicle’s main interface, either through a touchscreen or physical controls.
- The vehicle should be on a road where adaptive cruise control can operate effectively (e.g., clear lane, minimal obstruction, and safe road conditions).

**4. Trigger conditions**  
- The user accesses the Adaptive Cruise Control customization interface via the vehicle’s dashboard or touchscreen.
- The user selects a customization option (e.g., speed limit, following distance, driving mode).
- The system detects valid input from the user interface, such as setting a new speed preference or following distance.
- The vehicle speed and sensor data allow for adjustments to the cruise control settings (e.g., the system detects the road and traffic conditions as suitable for adaptive control).
- The system confirms the validity of the user’s selected options before applying them to the vehicle’s operation.

**5. Execution output**  
- The system adjusts the Adaptive Cruise Control settings in real time, including setting the preferred speed, following distance, and driving mode.
- The vehicle’s cruise control operates with the new settings, modifying the driving behavior in accordance with the chosen customization parameters.
- Feedback is provided to the user via the system interface, confirming that the settings have been applied successfully (e.g., “Settings updated” notification).
- The system adjusts its driving strategies, such as maintaining the set following distance or adjusting speed based on traffic conditions and road scenarios, according to the user’s preferences.
  
**6. Exit conditions**  
- The system enters a stable operational state where the Adaptive Cruise Control responds to road conditions, traffic, and vehicle speed according to the customized settings.
- User-selected settings are saved and persist across subsequent trips, ensuring that the system continues to operate with the customized parameters unless manually adjusted again.
- If the user exits the customization menu, the system remains in the customized state, applying the user-defined settings until the system is turned off or reset.
- If any error or malfunction occurs, the system enters a fallback mode, where customization options may be temporarily unavailable, and standard settings are applied automatically.
