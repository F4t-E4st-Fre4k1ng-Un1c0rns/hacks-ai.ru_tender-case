**Title**  
Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization - Technical Specifications

**Functional Description**  
The Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization provides limited adjustment capabilities, focusing primarily on basic following distance settings. The feature lacks specific controls for fine-tuning acceleration, deceleration, and speed adaptation, offering instead a standardized set of parameters that apply universally across different driving scenarios.

**Enabling Conditions**  
1. The vehicle must be powered on for the system to function; however, there are no restrictions against making adjustments while the vehicle is in motion.
2. Access to customization options is limited to the vehicle's central dashboard, with no provision for remote or mobile application access.

**Trigger Conditions**  
The system is accessed through the “Cruise Control Settings” menu on the vehicle’s dashboard interface. Users can adjust settings regardless of vehicle movement status, as no restrictions are enforced for safe stationary conditions.

**Execution Output**  
The system saves a general setting for following distance without additional options for individual sensitivity adjustments in acceleration or deceleration. The adaptive cruise control operates according to this standard setting, regardless of driving style or environmental conditions.

**Exit Conditions**  
Settings do not persist across driving sessions; any adjustments revert to the default configuration upon vehicle restart. This requires users to reapply their preferred settings each time the system is activated.
