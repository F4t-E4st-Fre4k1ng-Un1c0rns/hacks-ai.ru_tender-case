### 2. Functional Description
The Wireless Charging Station Integration for Electric Vehicles (EV) provides a seamless, automated solution for charging luxury electric vehicles using inductive charging technology. The system will automatically detect when the vehicle is within range of the charging pad, align itself, and begin charging without requiring any manual interaction. Charging progress will be monitored and displayed via an app or the vehicle’s in-built system, offering real-time updates on battery level and estimated charging time. The system ensures that users can easily charge their vehicle by simply positioning it near the charging station, eliminating the need for physical connectors.

### 3. Enabling Conditions
- The vehicle must be equipped with a compatible wireless charging receiver that can communicate with the charging station.
- The vehicle must be within a 1-meter range of the charging pad for automatic detection.
- The charging station must be installed correctly, with proper alignment and power supply, to ensure reliable operation.
- The vehicle must be in a charging-ready state (either powered off or in a state that allows charging to commence).
- A valid user account with updated billing information must be available for tracking the session, if applicable.
- The wireless charging system should be operational, with no maintenance issues, and able to communicate with the vehicle via secure protocols.

### 4. Trigger Conditions
- The vehicle enters the detection range (approximately 1 meter) of the charging station, prompting the system to begin alignment and communication.
- The vehicle is aligned within the necessary position for charging to commence automatically, as determined by system sensors.
- The vehicle is powered off or in a mode that allows for wireless charging.
- The system detects any power failure or system malfunction, interrupting the charging process and requiring user attention.

### 5. Execution Output
- The system will establish a secure wireless connection between the vehicle and the charging station.
- Charging will automatically begin once the vehicle is properly aligned, with no further manual interaction required.
- Charging progress will be updated in real-time via a mobile app or the vehicle’s display, showing the battery level, charging speed, and estimated time to full charge.
- If charging is interrupted for any reason, the system will attempt to re-establish the connection or notify the user of the issue, providing troubleshooting instructions.

### 6. Exit Conditions
- The vehicle’s battery is fully charged, and the system will automatically disengage the wireless charging process.
- Charging may be manually stopped by the user, either through the app or vehicle controls, if desired.
- After the session is complete, the system will notify the user of the successful charging completion and the battery status.
- If any errors or issues occur during charging (e.g., system malfunction, power failure), the system will prompt the user with the next steps for resolution.
