Technical Specifications for Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System

**2. Functional Description:**
The Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System (RTCAWS) is designed to enhance vehicle safety by providing real-time alerts and automatic interventions in the event of a potential collision. The system utilizes a combination of high-performance sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar, along with real-time data processing, to monitor the environment around the vehicle. It detects obstacles, other vehicles, and sudden changes in the driving environment, warning the driver and, when necessary, intervening with automatic braking or steering adjustments to prevent or mitigate a collision.

**3. Enabling Conditions:**
- The vehicle must be equipped with radar sensors, cameras, lidar, and a real-time data processing unit capable of handling input from these sensors.
- The RTCAWS must be activated automatically when the vehicle enters a driving mode or manually by the driver through the vehicle’s interface.
- The vehicle’s engine and control systems must be fully operational, with the vehicle in motion for collision detection and intervention capabilities to be fully active.
- The system must be calibrated and ready to operate within specified environmental conditions, including various weather scenarios, road types, and lighting conditions.

**4. Trigger Conditions:**
- The system continuously scans the surrounding environment, looking for potential collision risks.
- If the system detects a vehicle or obstacle entering the vehicle’s path or moving at a speed that may lead to a collision, it triggers an alert.
- The system activates if there is a sudden decrease in speed from a vehicle in front, indicating a possible stop or hazard.
- The system will detect sharp lane changes or other unpredictable behaviors from surrounding vehicles.
- The system triggers if the vehicle is approaching a stationary or slow-moving object with insufficient braking distance to avoid collision.

**5. Execution Output:**
- When a potential collision is detected, the system will generate an immediate visual (dashboard light) and audible (sound alert) warning to the driver.
- If the system calculates a high risk of collision and no driver action is taken within a predefined timeframe, the system will automatically apply the brakes to reduce the severity of the collision or avoid it entirely.
- In cases where the threat is from the side or requires steering adjustment, the system may apply steering corrections to help avoid the collision.
- The system continuously monitors and updates the status of detected objects and recalculates the risk to provide real-time feedback to the driver.
- After each intervention or warning, the system logs the event for future analysis and review.

**6. Exit Conditions:**
- The system deactivates the warning and intervention actions when the immediate risk of collision has been eliminated, either through driver intervention or system-controlled actions (braking or steering).
- The system resets to a normal monitoring state once the danger has passed and no further threats are detected.
- In the event of a failure in system components or sensor data, a diagnostic message will appear on the vehicle’s display, and the system will enter a safe mode where full functionality may be temporarily suspended.
- Post-interaction, the system stores all relevant event data, including sensor data, intervention actions, and the system’s status during the event, for diagnostic purposes and continuous improvement.
