### 1. Title  
**In-Vehicle Cloud Storage for Personal Data and Music**

---

### 2. Functional Description  
The In-Vehicle Cloud Storage for Personal Data and Music subsystem allows users to store, access, and manage their personal data, including music libraries, preferences, and related content, via a secure cloud service. The system integrates with the vehicle’s infotainment platform, providing seamless synchronization of user data across all connected devices. This includes the ability to retrieve music playlists, personalized settings (e.g., seat positions, climate controls), and synchronize preferences across multiple sessions. In the event of an unavailable cloud connection, the system can revert to offline mode to provide limited functionality, such as offline music playback.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- **Cloud Account Setup**: A valid user account linked to the cloud storage service must be created and authenticated.
- **Vehicle Hardware**: The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary connectivity modules (cellular/Wi-Fi) and storage hardware to enable cloud interaction.
- **Internet Access**: The vehicle must be connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or cellular data, allowing communication with the cloud service.
- **User Consent**: The user must have agreed to the cloud service’s terms and conditions, ensuring data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- **Data Availability**: The cloud storage must be properly provisioned to store user data, including music, preferences, and settings.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- **User Entry into Vehicle**: The system is triggered when the user enters the vehicle, and the ignition is turned on, initiating the connection to the cloud service.
- **Media Selection**: The system triggers when the user selects the music option from the infotainment menu, prompting the retrieval of personal music data.
- **Preference Adjustment**: The system is triggered when the user changes preferences, such as adjusting seat position, climate settings, or music playback settings.
- **Synchronization Request**: Triggered when new data is available (e.g., new music uploads or updated preferences), requiring synchronization with the cloud.

### 5. Execution Output  
- **Data Synchronization**: The system retrieves the user’s music library, preferences, and other personal data from the cloud and synchronizes them with the vehicle’s infotainment system.
- **Music Playback**: The system streams the selected music from the cloud directly to the vehicle’s audio system, displaying relevant metadata such as album art and track information.
- **Real-Time Preferences Update**: The system continuously updates user preferences (e.g., seat settings, climate control) in real time and uploads these changes to the cloud for future use.
- **Offline Mode Activation**: In case of connectivity loss, the system switches to offline mode, allowing the user to access stored music and preferences without cloud interaction.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- **Successful Synchronization**: The system exits when the synchronization process is complete, and the user’s music and preferences are successfully updated in the vehicle and cloud.
- **End of Music Playback**: When the user stops or completes music playback, the system exits the media mode and returns to the main menu or idle screen.
- **Connection Failure**: If the system fails to establish a connection to the cloud, it enters a fallback mode, offering offline functionality or prompting the user to check their internet connection.
- **User Exit**: When the user exits the vehicle, the system terminates all active processes related to the cloud storage, saving any updates to preferences or media settings before shutting down.
