User Preferences Management for Infotainment System

---

**2. Functional Description**  
The User Preferences Management for the Infotainment System allows the system to store, retrieve, and apply personalized settings for the user. These settings include audio preferences (e.g., volume, music preferences), climate control settings, seat adjustments, and interface customization (e.g., theme settings). The subsystem ensures that each user has a unique profile, enabling seamless, personalized experiences upon entering the vehicle. The system will operate via both touch screen and voice command interfaces, allowing the user to modify and save preferences, which will be applied automatically the next time the user enters the vehicle.  

Key functional components include:  
- User profile creation, selection, and modification  
- Real-time retrieval and application of user preferences  
- Data synchronization with the vehicle’s infotainment system  
- Interface customization (e.g., layout, themes, background)  
- Integration with other vehicle subsystems like climate control, seat adjustment, and audio settings.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The infotainment system is powered on and initialized.  
- A user profile has been created and stored in the system, containing preference data (e.g., audio, seat position, climate control).  
- The vehicle’s internal sensors and subsystems (seat, climate control, audio system) are operational and can communicate with the infotainment system.  
- The user has access to the infotainment system via the touchscreen interface or voice commands.  
- The system has network connectivity for cloud synchronization (if applicable) and can update settings in real-time.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The user enters the vehicle, and the infotainment system recognizes the user profile based on either physical recognition (e.g., key fob or biometrics) or manual selection from the welcome screen.  
- The user interacts with the infotainment system by selecting a feature (e.g., adjusting seat position, audio settings, climate control).  
- A voice command is issued to modify any of the settings or preferences (e.g., “Set seat to my favorite position,” or “Increase volume”).  
- The system detects changes in the environment (e.g., cabin temperature) that trigger the application of saved user preferences.  
- The user saves any changes to their preferences, which triggers the system to update the user profile and store the new data.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system retrieves the correct user profile and applies saved preferences (audio settings, seat position, climate control, etc.).  
- User preferences are applied and updated in real-time, including adjustments to seat positioning, cabin temperature, music volume, and interface theme.  
- If a preference update occurs (e.g., the user adjusts seat position), the system saves these changes to the user profile, ensuring they are applied the next time the user enters the vehicle.  
- The system confirms the applied changes through a visual or audio confirmation (e.g., a message on the screen or a confirmation beep).  
- If a setting cannot be applied (e.g., due to malfunction), the system displays an error message or offers an alternative solution (e.g., manual control or default settings).

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Criteria**  
- The user successfully exits the system by either logging out or turning off the vehicle, at which point the system saves any new preferences and closes the current session.  
- If the system encounters a failure in applying user preferences (e.g., seat adjustment motor failure), the user is informed with a clear error message, and a default or manual fallback option is provided.  
- If the system fails to load or retrieve a user profile (e.g., due to a corrupted profile or system malfunction), the user is prompted to select a default profile or create a new one.  
- Upon successful interaction, the system returns to the home screen or previous state, with all user preferences applied and saved.  
- When the user exits the vehicle, any unsaved preferences are either saved automatically or discarded, depending on the system’s configuration.
