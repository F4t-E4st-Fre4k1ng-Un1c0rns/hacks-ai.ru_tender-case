**1. Title**  
User Preferences Management for Infotainment System

**2. Functional description**  
The User Preferences Management sub-system allows users to personalize and manage their preferences for the vehicle's infotainment system. This includes adjusting settings such as audio profiles, display themes, navigation preferences, and connected apps. The system supports multiple user profiles, enabling individual customization for each user. The preferences are saved and applied automatically when the user re-enters the vehicle or accesses the infotainment system. The system ensures a seamless user experience by retaining these settings and minimizing the need for reconfiguration.  

**3. Enabling conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with an infotainment system capable of managing user profiles and preferences.  
- A valid user profile must be created or linked to the infotainment system, which can be done either manually through the vehicle or automatically via a mobile app.  
- The system must be connected to a central cloud server or vehicle's main system for profile synchronization and data storage.  
- The vehicle must support the storage and recall of at least two separate user profiles, allowing multiple users to customize settings independently.

**4. Trigger conditions**  
- The system is activated when the infotainment system is powered on.  
- The system detects an active user profile upon startup either through biometric recognition (if available) or manual login.  
- The user accesses the 'User Preferences' section of the infotainment menu, either through voice commands, touchscreen inputs, or physical buttons on the dashboard.  

**5. Execution output**  
- The system applies the saved preferences immediately upon activation, including audio settings, display themes, and navigation settings.  
- Customizations such as volume levels, theme changes, or layout adjustments are reflected in real-time as the user interacts with the system.  
- The system displays a confirmation message after each preference is saved: "Settings successfully updated."  
- The system ensures that preferences are retained for future sessions, automatically applying the user-defined settings when the user returns to the vehicle.  

**6. Exit conditions**  
- After saving the preferences, the system returns the user to the main infotainment screen, displaying the updated settings.  
- If the user chooses to cancel without saving, the system exits the preferences screen and retains the previously saved settings.  
- Upon user logout, the system successfully logs out the current profile and reverts to the default or last used profile settings.  
- In case of an error, the system will notify the user and prompt for corrective action, such as re-login or resetting the preferences.
