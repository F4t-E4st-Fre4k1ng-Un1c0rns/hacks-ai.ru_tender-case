### 2. Functional Description  
The Vehicle Data Analytics for Fleet Management sub-System is designed to enable fleet managers to monitor and optimize the performance of their electric vehicle fleet. The system provides real-time data analytics on vehicle health, energy consumption, driving behavior, predictive maintenance, and route optimization. It also supports the generation of reports to assist in decision-making for improving fleet efficiency and reducing costs. The system integrates with the fleet's central management platform, collecting and processing data from vehicle sensors to offer actionable insights.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The fleet management platform must be connected to electric vehicles with installed sensors that provide real-time data, such as battery status, mileage, and health metrics.
- The fleet manager must have valid user credentials and access to the Vehicle Data Analytics dashboard.
- Regular synchronization between the vehicles and the cloud system is required to ensure up-to-date data.
- A stable internet connection must be available for accessing the Vehicle Data Analytics features.
- The sub-System must be properly integrated with the fleet's central management system to facilitate data exchange and reporting.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The system is triggered to collect vehicle data automatically whenever a vehicle is in operation.
- The fleet manager triggers the data collection and analytics when logging into the system and accessing the "Vehicle Data Analytics" section.
- Predictive maintenance alerts are triggered when vehicle performance metrics, such as battery level or mileage, exceed predefined thresholds.
- The sub-System triggers the generation of performance reports when the fleet manager selects one or more vehicles for analysis.

### 5. Execution Output  
- The sub-System generates a detailed dashboard showing the current health, energy consumption, and performance of each vehicle in the fleet.
- Real-time data on vehicle location, battery levels, and other key metrics are displayed for the fleet manager.
- The system produces analytical reports on overall fleet performance, including insights on energy consumption, maintenance needs, and route optimization.
- Predictive maintenance alerts are generated based on the analysis of vehicle data, and recommendations for improvements are provided.
- Analytics tools offer fleet managers the ability to make data-driven decisions regarding vehicle usage, maintenance scheduling, and route planning.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The sub-System exits when the fleet manager logs out of the platform or navigates to a different section of the system.
- If the fleet manager exits without saving any changes, the system prompts the user to confirm whether to discard the unsaved data.
- Once the analysis is complete and reports are generated, the system saves the data and updates the vehicle status accordingly.
- After the system exits, the updated data is synchronized with the cloud for future reference and analysis.
