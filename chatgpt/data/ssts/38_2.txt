Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System - Technical Specifications

**Functional Description**  
The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System (DBMFS) is designed to monitor key driving behaviors to improve driver safety and vehicle efficiency. The system tracks driving metrics such as speed, acceleration, braking, lane changes, and other indicators of safe driving. The system provides real-time feedback to the driver on their performance and generates a summary report after each trip, which includes a safety score, areas for improvement, and any critical alerts. The system is designed to encourage safe driving behaviors and optimize energy consumption.

**Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with sensors capable of tracking speed, acceleration, braking force, lane detection, and GPS positioning.
- The system must be integrated with the vehicle's onboard diagnostics (OBD) system and internal software to collect real-time data.
- The system must be calibrated prior to use to ensure accurate monitoring and feedback.
- The vehicle's software must support real-time data processing and feedback delivery.
- The driver must agree to participate in data collection as per the vehicle's privacy policy and legal compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR).

**Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is activated automatically when the vehicle’s engine is turned on and the vehicle starts moving.
- The system will also be triggered if significant deviations from normal driving behavior are detected (e.g., hard braking, excessive acceleration).
- The system automatically starts tracking when the vehicle reaches a speed threshold or detects lane changes during driving.

**Execution Output**  
- Real-time feedback is provided to the driver via the dashboard display, indicating whether the driving behavior is safe, efficient, or needs improvement.
- After each trip, the system generates a summary report that includes a safety score, a breakdown of driving behaviors (e.g., braking, acceleration), and specific alerts for unsafe driving patterns.
- The system also provides suggestions to improve driving habits, such as maintaining a steady speed or avoiding sharp turns.

**Exit Conditions**  
- The system deactivates when the vehicle is turned off or if a system error prevents its operation.
- The system will stop tracking and providing feedback once the vehicle has been stationary for more than 5 minutes or if the driver manually exits the system interface.
- The system will also exit if it detects an issue that requires troubleshooting, such as sensor malfunction or failure to integrate with the vehicle’s diagnostic system.
