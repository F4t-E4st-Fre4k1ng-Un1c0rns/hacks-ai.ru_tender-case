   Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System - Technical Specifications

2. **Functional Description**  
   The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System is designed to provide quick and reliable evacuation assistance for vehicle occupants in the event of a life-threatening emergency such as a fire, collision, or hazardous environment. The system automatically unlocks all doors upon detection of a critical event and provides clear auditory and visual evacuation instructions to guide users to safety. It integrates with emergency response services, transmitting the vehicle's location and emergency details. Additionally, it offers backup manual options in case of system failures.

3. **Enabling Conditions**  
   - The system must be integrated into the vehicle’s main control and safety networks, with access to sensors that detect critical events (e.g., fire, collision, hazardous gases).
   - Vehicle must have an operational primary or backup power source to activate the system during emergencies, even in powered-off states.
   - User profiles must be pre-configured with emergency contact details and medical data, which are used to send automatic alerts in case of evacuation.
   - The vehicle’s sensors must be calibrated to accurately detect emergencies and differentiate between critical and non-critical events.
   - Emergency response systems must be linked to the vehicle’s communication system to relay incident details accurately.

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - Detection of a life-threatening event by the vehicle’s sensor system, including collision impact, fire, air quality issues, or other sensor-identified risks.
   - Manual activation by the driver or any passenger, triggered by a panic button or voice command indicating emergency conditions.
   - Automatic recognition of key vehicle safety system failures, such as airbag deployment, seatbelt disengagement, or a crash.

5. **Execution Output**  
   - Immediate unlocking of all doors to allow for quick egress.
   - Activation of visual and auditory evacuation prompts, guiding occupants to the nearest and safest exit route.
   - Transmission of an emergency distress signal, including vehicle location, to local emergency services for rapid response.
   - If door unlocking fails, alternative manual release methods are provided, along with escape instructions via the vehicle’s interior system.
   - Continuous monitoring and feedback are provided to ensure the system operates correctly, including a log of system performance during the evacuation.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - All passengers have safely exited the vehicle, following the evacuation instructions provided by the system.
   - Emergency services have been notified and have confirmed receipt of the distress signal, including the vehicle’s location and details of the emergency.
   - The system resets after the emergency event, logging all actions taken and any failures or system discrepancies for post-incident analysis and improvement.
