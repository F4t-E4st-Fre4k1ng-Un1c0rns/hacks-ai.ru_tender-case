**Title: Remote Engine Start/Stop via Mobile App - Technical Specifications**

**Functional Description:**
The Remote Engine Start/Stop via Mobile App sub-system allows authorized users to remotely start and stop the engine of their luxury electric vehicle using a mobile application. This functionality enhances user convenience by enabling control of the vehicle’s engine before entry (e.g., warming the car) or remotely turning off the engine to conserve energy or secure the vehicle when not in use. The sub-system is designed to provide a secure and efficient interface between the user’s mobile device and the vehicle’s engine control system.

**Enabling Conditions:**
1. The vehicle must be equipped with the Remote Engine Start/Stop system, which is installed and integrated into the vehicle’s powertrain and communication infrastructure.
2. The mobile application must be installed and configured on the user’s smartphone, with the latest updates to support compatibility with the vehicle's engine control system.
3. The user must have an active, authenticated account, allowing authorized access to the vehicle’s remote functionalities.
4. The mobile app and vehicle must be within operational range (mobile network or Bluetooth), ensuring a reliable communication link between the two devices.
5. The vehicle must have sufficient battery power for remote operation, and all safety systems (e.g., immobilizer, security) must be functional.

**Trigger Conditions:**
1. The user opens the mobile app and selects the "Remote Engine Start/Stop" feature.
2. The mobile app establishes a secure connection with the vehicle, verifying the user’s identity through authentication (e.g., password, biometric).
3. The user selects either the "Start Engine" or "Stop Engine" option within the app interface.
4. The vehicle must be in a safe, stationary state to receive the engine start/stop command (e.g., parked and not in motion).
5. The mobile app receives confirmation that the vehicle is within range and able to process the command.

**Execution Output:**
1. Upon a successful engine start request, the vehicle’s engine is activated, and the app displays a confirmation message that the engine is now running and the vehicle is ready for use.
2. Upon a successful engine stop request, the vehicle’s engine is powered off, and the app displays a notification confirming that the engine has been successfully stopped and the vehicle is in standby mode.
3. If the action cannot be completed (e.g., vehicle out of range, insufficient battery), the app will display an error message indicating the issue and suggesting possible actions (e.g., move closer, check vehicle status).
4. The vehicle will enter the appropriate state based on the command (operational for engine start, or shutdown for engine stop).

**Exit Conditions:**
1. After a successful engine start or stop, the system reverts to an idle state, with the app ready to accept further commands.
2. If the engine start or stop action is unsuccessful, the system provides a notification to the user and allows them to attempt the action again or contact customer support.
3. After completing the action, the system ensures that the vehicle’s safety protocols (e.g., security and battery monitoring) are reactivated and operational.
4. The system ensures that the vehicle enters a safe mode if any issues are detected during the process (e.g., low battery, unsafe vehicle condition).
