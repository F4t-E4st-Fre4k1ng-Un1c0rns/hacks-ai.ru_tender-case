In-Car Payment System Integration for Toll and Parking

---

**2. Functional Description**  
The In-Car Payment System Integration for Toll and Parking enables seamless, automated payment processing for toll and parking fees directly from the vehicle's infotainment system. Upon approach to a toll or parking area, the system detects the entry point and initiates payment processing based on pre-registered user preferences. The system supports multiple payment methods (credit card, debit card, or digital wallet) and ensures a secure and user-friendly experience. The vehicle provides feedback via the infotainment screen, confirming payment and allowing the driver to proceed without delay.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with an active internet connection, either via built-in cellular data or Wi-Fi, for real-time payment processing.  
- The vehicle's software must be up-to-date to ensure compatibility with the latest version of the In-Car Payment System Integration. Regular software updates must be installed automatically or manually by the user.  
- The user must register at least one valid payment method (credit card, debit card, or digital wallet) in the system settings. The system will periodically validate the payment method to ensure it is active and valid.  
- The toll and parking facilities must support integration with the In-Car Payment System to enable seamless transactions. Compatibility checks should be performed to ensure the system's operational effectiveness with local infrastructure.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is triggered when the vehicle approaches a toll or parking area that is integrated with compatible payment infrastructure.  
- Upon entry to a toll road or parking facility, the system automatically detects the presence of the toll or parking gate and displays the payment option on the vehicle's infotainment screen.  
- The user is prompted to select a payment method if one has not been pre-selected. If the user has a default payment method set, the system will automatically initiate the payment process without further input.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system processes the payment using the selected or default registered payment method and provides a confirmation message on the vehicle's infotainment system.  
- The transaction details, including amount and transaction ID, are displayed on the screen for the user’s reference.  
- A digital receipt is generated and stored within the vehicle’s history log. The user is given the option to receive the receipt via email or download it for future reference.  
- The system sends payment confirmation to the toll or parking system, granting access (e.g., opening of toll gates or granting parking area entry).

---

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The user successfully completes the transaction, receiving confirmation of the payment and access to the toll or parking facility without manual intervention.  
- If the payment is unsuccessful, the system notifies the user of the failure, provides an error code, and offers an alternative payment method (e.g., using a smartphone app or manual payment).  
- Upon transaction completion, whether successful or unsuccessful, the system logs the payment history and resets to the ready state for the next transaction attempt. The user is logged out after successful transaction completion or error resolution.
