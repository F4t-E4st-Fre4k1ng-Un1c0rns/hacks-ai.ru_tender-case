AI-based Driver Assistance for Hazard Detection – Technical Specifications

**2. Functional Description**  
The AI-based Driver Assistance for Hazard Detection system is designed to continuously monitor the vehicle’s surroundings and detect potential hazards, such as pedestrians, obstacles, vehicles, or adverse road conditions. The system uses a combination of sensors (cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors) and AI algorithms to identify risks and provide real-time alerts to the driver. These alerts include visual, auditory, and haptic feedback to ensure prompt reaction to hazardous situations. The system is aimed at enhancing driving safety, minimizing the risk of accidents, and improving driver awareness in various driving conditions.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with compatible sensors (e.g., cameras, radar, LIDAR, ultrasonic sensors) and an AI processing unit capable of real-time data analysis.
- The system must be integrated into the vehicle’s control architecture and activated when the vehicle is in "Drive," "Reverse," or "Park" mode, depending on the operational need.
- The vehicle’s power supply must be stable, with no issues affecting the sensors, cameras, or AI processing unit.
- The system must be calibrated for accurate hazard detection across various driving environments and conditions (e.g., urban, rural, highway).
- The system must remain operational and able to detect hazards at low speeds (e.g., during parking or in traffic) as well as at higher speeds on highways.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is activated when the vehicle transitions from "Park" to "Drive" or "Reverse" mode, ensuring hazard detection is available in all driving situations, including parking.
- The system detects movement or changes in the environment, such as pedestrians crossing the road, approaching vehicles, or sudden obstacles.
- The system detects adverse road conditions such as poor visibility (fog, rain), slippery roads, or potholes that may require the driver’s attention.
- Any anomaly in vehicle trajectory (e.g., sudden lane departures, sharp turns) or proximity to obstacles triggers hazard detection.
- The system continuously scans the surrounding environment and updates hazard alerts in real-time as the vehicle moves.

**5. Execution Output**  
- **Visual alerts**: A visual icon or message on the dashboard or central display to inform the driver of a detected hazard.
- **Auditory alerts**: A chime, beep, or voice prompt indicating the presence of a potential hazard.
- **Haptic feedback**: Vibration in the steering wheel, seat, or pedals to provide immediate physical feedback for high-priority hazards, especially when the vehicle is in motion.
- **Severity-based alert system**: Alerts will vary in priority based on the severity of the hazard. Critical alerts (e.g., a pedestrian suddenly entering the vehicle’s path) trigger urgent responses, while non-imminent risks (e.g., a slowly approaching vehicle) will generate lower-priority alerts.
- **Event logging**: The system logs all detected hazards, including the type, severity, time, and location, for review during vehicle diagnostics or user review.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system returns to its monitoring mode once the detected hazard has been cleared or is no longer a threat (e.g., the pedestrian has crossed the road or the obstacle is no longer in the vehicle’s path).
- The system continuously monitors the environment even after an alert has been issued, ensuring that secondary hazards or changes in the environment do not go undetected.
- The system deactivates alerts when the vehicle reaches a safe distance from the hazard or the hazard is no longer relevant.
- If the hazard persists or the vehicle continues to approach the hazard, the system will provide repeated or updated alerts until the situation is resolved.
- If the system is manually deactivated by the driver through the settings menu, the system will exit monitoring mode and cease hazard detection until re-enabled.
