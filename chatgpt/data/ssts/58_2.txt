Technical Specifications for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication Integration

**2. Functional Description**  
The Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication Integration system provides a seamless interface between electric vehicles and surrounding infrastructure. This system enables the following key functions:
- Real-time communication with traffic signals for dynamic routing and signal phase timing.
- Notifications for nearby and available charging stations, along with optimal charging recommendations based on proximity and status.
- Alerts for road conditions, traffic congestion, accidents, and environmental hazards from smart infrastructure.
- Integration with smart road signs for speed limit adjustments and hazard warnings.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
The following conditions must be met for the V2I Communication Integration system to operate effectively:
- The vehicle is equipped with V2I communication hardware and software, capable of transmitting and receiving data from external infrastructure.
- The surrounding infrastructure (traffic signals, road signs, charging stations) must be compatible with V2I communication standards and operational.
- The vehicle’s navigation and communication systems must be powered on and connected to the V2I network.
- User permission must be granted for data exchange between the vehicle and the surrounding infrastructure elements.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
The system becomes active under the following conditions:
- The vehicle’s ignition is turned on and the communication system initializes.
- The vehicle enters the operational range of compatible infrastructure (such as within range of a traffic light or charging station).
- The user sets a destination or begins navigating via the vehicle’s route planner, triggering the system to gather relevant infrastructure data.
- The vehicle encounters real-time conditions (e.g., traffic changes, hazards) that prompt a data exchange with surrounding infrastructure.

**5. Execution Output**  
When the system operates successfully, the following outputs are generated:
- Real-time adjustments to the vehicle’s speed and route based on traffic signal timings, real-time traffic conditions, and route optimization data.
- Notifications on the vehicle’s display for available charging stations, including location, availability, and optimal charging times.
- Alerts for road hazards, traffic congestion, accidents, or environmental conditions, which may influence the vehicle’s route or behavior.
- Speed limit adjustments based on smart road sign communication, ensuring compliance with real-time regulations.
- A seamless driving experience with proactive, automated system responses to infrastructure interactions, ensuring greater efficiency and safety.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
The V2I Communication Integration system exits the active mode under the following conditions:
- The vehicle moves out of the operational range of compatible infrastructure (e.g., leaving the range of a traffic light or charging station).
- The vehicle’s communication system is turned off or disabled.
- The vehicle enters a mode where manual driving takes precedence (e.g., manual override, system disengagement).
- Connectivity to the V2I infrastructure is lost due to network failure, technical issues, or other external factors. In this case, the system enters a fallback mode with limited functionality.
