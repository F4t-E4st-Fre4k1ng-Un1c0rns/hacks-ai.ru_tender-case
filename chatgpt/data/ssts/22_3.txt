**Technical Specifications: Real-Time Parking Availability Notifications**

**1. Title**  
Real-Time Parking Availability Notifications

**2. Functional Description**  
The Real-Time Parking Availability Notifications sub-System is designed to provide luxury electric vehicle (EV) users with real-time updates on the availability of parking spaces in their vicinity. The system will send notifications when parking spaces become available, when spaces are almost full, or when parking locations are at capacity. Notifications will also include estimated time until spaces are full or freed up, helping users plan their parking accordingly. The sub-System will work through an in-vehicle system or a mobile application, based on user preferences.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The system must be integrated with local parking sensors, cameras, and third-party APIs that provide live data for parking space availability.
- The user must have an active account and the necessary permissions to access parking availability notifications.
- The vehicle or mobile device must have the required hardware and software to interact with the Real-Time Parking Availability Notifications system.
- A stable network connection (Wi-Fi, 4G, or 5G) must be available for real-time data transmission.
- The system must have access to updated parking data from external sources, including third-party API providers.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The user opens the app or in-vehicle system to check for available parking locations nearby.
- The user selects a specific parking location to monitor and enable notifications for real-time availability.
- A parking space becomes available or occupied, triggering a status update in the system.
- The user requests notifications for a specific parking location based on availability or proximity.
- The system detects a change in parking space availability, such as a space becoming available or a location approaching full capacity.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Real-time status updates of nearby parking locations, indicating availability (e.g., "Spaces available," "Almost full," "Full").
- Notifications sent to the user when parking spaces become available or when spaces are near full capacity.
- Notifications include an estimated time for when a parking space will be full or freed up, if applicable.
- Detailed information on each parking location, such as proximity, fees (if any), and number of spaces available.
- A confirmation notification when a parking space becomes available for parking.
- The system continuously updates the parking status to reflect real-time changes as the user approaches the location.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The user successfully parks their vehicle in a space after receiving a notification that a spot is available.
- The user exits the app or vehicle interface, ending the session, either after parking or abandoning the search for parking.
- The system fails to retrieve parking availability data due to network or sensor failure, and the user is notified of the issue. In this case, the system may suggest alternative parking locations or allow the user to retry.
- The system logs the user’s interaction, including data on parking space usage and system performance, for future improvements.
