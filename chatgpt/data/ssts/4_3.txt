User Preferences Management for Infotainment System - Technical Specifications

---

**2. Functional Description**

The User Preferences Management subsystem for the Infotainment System allows users to save, retrieve, and modify their personal preferences for the vehicle’s entertainment, climate, and navigation settings. This subsystem supports user profiles, which store tailored settings for each driver. While the system is partially compliant, some features may not be fully optimized, and certain conditions may result in degraded performance or limited functionality. The system is intended to provide a personalized experience by automatically applying the saved settings upon user authentication.

**3. Enabling Conditions**

1. The infotainment system must be installed and powered on, with no critical malfunctions.
2. The system must have access to the user profile database, with all required data (e.g., saved preferences, authentication credentials) properly stored.
3. The vehicle must be equipped with compatible climate, media, and navigation hardware that can communicate with the infotainment system.
4. User authentication methods (e.g., PIN, voice recognition, or proximity detection) must be functional and available for profile access.
5. The system must be connected to necessary external devices (e.g., smartphone, USB drive) for media preferences, if applicable.
6. The user must be in the vehicle and within range of the infotainment system’s communication capabilities (e.g., Bluetooth or direct connection).

**4. Trigger Conditions**

1. The user enters the vehicle and powers on the infotainment system, initiating the system’s profile recognition process.
2. A user action, such as selecting audio settings, adjusting the climate, or choosing navigation routes, triggers the system to check and apply saved preferences.
3. A new device or media source is connected to the system (e.g., Bluetooth device, USB drive), prompting a need to update or modify media preferences.
4. A change in driving conditions (e.g., sudden temperature variation, seating adjustments) may trigger automatic adjustments based on saved preferences, if applicable.
5. The system detects a user profile mismatch or failure to recognize the user, initiating an error message and prompting the user to authenticate again.

**5. Execution Output**

1. The system loads and applies the relevant user profile upon successful authentication, adjusting preferences such as volume, climate settings, navigation preferences, and media.
2. If the system recognizes an issue with loading or applying the profile, an error message is generated, prompting the user to attempt re-authentication or manual adjustments.
3. Any changes made by the user during the session (e.g., volume change, new playlist selection, climate adjustment) are saved to the active user profile.
4. If the profile is successfully updated, a confirmation message or visual feedback is displayed to indicate the changes were successfully saved.
5. If partial functionality is detected (e.g., voice command failure, connectivity issues), the system notifies the user and offers alternative methods for interaction (e.g., touch interface).

**6. Exit Conditions**

1. Upon successful profile interaction, all user settings (e.g., audio, climate, navigation, media) are saved to the user’s profile for future use.
2. The system confirms that changes have been stored, and the user profile is updated to reflect any new preferences.
3. If the system experiences a malfunction or fails to save preferences, an error message will inform the user of the issue, and the user will be prompted to retry or use a reduced functionality mode.
4. The user exits the vehicle, and the system automatically saves the preferences to the user profile, ensuring that they are available the next time the user enters the vehicle.
5. If the system encounters a partial compliance issue, such as unavailable features or degraded performance, the system will attempt to restore functionality but may prompt the user to use alternative interfaces or retry at a later time.
