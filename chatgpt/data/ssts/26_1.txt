**Technical Specifications: Remote Engine Start/Stop via Mobile App**

1. **Title:**
   Remote Engine Start/Stop via Mobile App

2. **Functional description:**
   The Remote Engine Start/Stop sub-system allows users to remotely control the starting and stopping of their vehicle’s engine via a mobile application. This functionality also enables pre-conditioning of the vehicle cabin, adjusting the temperature to the user’s preferences when the engine is started. The system securely communicates with the vehicle’s embedded control system and provides feedback through the mobile app, confirming the success or failure of the command. Users can interact with this feature via a simple interface that reflects real-time engine status.

3. **Enabling conditions:**
   - The vehicle must be equipped with the required hardware, including a wireless communication module and an engine control interface capable of receiving and processing remote start/stop commands.
   - The user must have a registered and authenticated account within the mobile app, with secure access permissions enabled (via username/password or biometric authentication).
   - The vehicle must be within operational range for communication with the mobile app, and the vehicle must be in a condition where remote control is allowed (e.g., not in active driving mode).
   - The mobile app must be installed, up-to-date, and properly configured on the user’s device to ensure secure communication with the vehicle.
   - The vehicle must be in an unlocked state to enable remote engine control (if applicable).

4. **Trigger conditions:**
   - The mobile app is launched and the user is successfully authenticated.
   - The user selects the "Engine Start/Stop" option from the main menu of the app.
   - The vehicle is in a valid operational state, where remote control is permitted (e.g., not in restricted mode).
   - The user taps the "Start Engine" or "Stop Engine" button within the mobile app interface.
   - The app sends a secure command to the vehicle to either start or stop the engine based on the user's action.

5. **Execution output:**
   - When the "Start Engine" command is successfully executed, the vehicle’s engine is powered on, and the cabin temperature is adjusted according to pre-set preferences (if applicable). A notification is sent to the mobile app confirming the action with the message “Engine Started.”
   - When the "Stop Engine" command is successfully executed, the vehicle’s engine is powered off, and the app confirms the action with the message “Engine Stopped.”
   - If the command is unsuccessful, the mobile app displays an error message indicating the reason for failure (e.g., "Unable to start engine: vehicle locked" or "Unable to stop engine: low battery"). The app also offers troubleshooting guidance.

6. **Exit conditions:**
   - The engine has successfully been started or stopped based on the user’s input, and the mobile app reflects the updated status of the vehicle’s engine.
   - The cabin temperature is adjusted (if applicable) when the engine is started, and the vehicle remains in a secure state (either running or off) after the command is executed.
   - The user receives a notification confirming that the engine status has been updated, and any relevant feedback about the operation (e.g., temperature adjustments, security checks) is displayed.
