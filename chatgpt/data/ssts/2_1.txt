Technical Specifications for Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance)

**2. Functional Description**  
The Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance) provides an automated solution for parking a vehicle in a designated parking spot. The system utilizes an array of sensors (ultrasonic, radar, and cameras) to detect available parking spaces, assess the environment, and automatically control the steering, braking, and acceleration of the vehicle to park the car with minimal driver input. The system aims to improve parking accuracy, reduce the risk of collisions, and enhance user convenience, ensuring the vehicle is parked in a suitable spot with proper alignment and without human intervention.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle is equipped with the necessary hardware components, including ultrasonic sensors, radar, cameras, and onboard processing units.  
- The vehicle's software is running the latest version of the parking assistance system, configured and tested for proper functionality.  
- Environmental conditions must support the operation of the system (e.g., clear weather, no heavy interference from external signals, temperatures within operating ranges).  
- The parking area must be clear of obstacles or other vehicles that could interfere with the automated parking process.  
- The vehicle must be in an operational state with fully functional drive and braking systems.  
- The parking system is enabled through the user interface (either through the dashboard or voice command) when the vehicle is in proximity to a parking space.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is triggered when the user activates the automated parking feature using the vehicle’s dashboard controls, steering wheel buttons, or voice command.  
- The system automatically scans the surrounding area for available parking spots once it is engaged.  
- A suitable parking spot is identified by the system (based on predefined parameters such as space size and surrounding clearance).  
- A safe environment for parking is confirmed by the system’s sensors, with no obstacles or interference detected within the parking zone.  
- The vehicle must be traveling at low speed (typically less than 10 km/h) and in proximity to the selected parking spot for the system to initiate parking procedures.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Upon activation, the system controls the steering, acceleration, and braking of the vehicle to autonomously maneuver into the parking spot.  
- The system continuously monitors the surrounding environment via its sensors and adjusts the vehicle’s movement accordingly to avoid collisions.  
- The vehicle is aligned within the parking space with precision, ensuring both safety and proper positioning.  
- Visual and auditory signals are provided to the driver, indicating the successful engagement and completion of the parking process.  
- If successful, the system will notify the driver via the vehicle’s display (e.g., "Parking Complete"), and the vehicle is automatically brought to a stop within the designated parking spot.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system disengages once the vehicle is securely parked and the parking process is complete.  
- If an obstacle is detected during the parking process, the system will issue a warning to the driver and stop the parking procedure, prompting manual intervention.  
- In case of a malfunction (e.g., sensor failure or environmental interference), the system will alert the driver and recommend turning off the automated parking feature, requiring the driver to park the vehicle manually.  
- The system will also exit if the vehicle exceeds the designated parking space or if it detects an unsafe condition that requires the user to manually correct the parking procedure.
