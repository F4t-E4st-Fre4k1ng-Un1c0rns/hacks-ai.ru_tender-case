**Title:**  
Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration - Technical Specifications

**1. Functional Description:**  
The V2V Integration system enables vehicles to exchange real-time data such as location, speed, and direction to enhance situational awareness and safety. This system provides timely alerts to the driver about nearby vehicles, sudden changes in driving behavior, and potential hazards like traffic congestion. It ensures seamless communication between compatible vehicles, contributing to a safer driving experience by anticipating risks and enabling cooperative vehicle behavior.

**2. Enabling Conditions:**  
- Both vehicles must have V2V-enabled systems with compatible hardware and software versions.
- The vehicles must be within a communication range of 200 meters for data exchange.
- The V2V system must be activated, either manually by the driver or automatically upon vehicle startup.
- Vehicles must have an active GPS and communication module to ensure accurate data sharing.

**3. Trigger Conditions:**  
- **Proximity Detection:** Triggered when another V2V-enabled vehicle enters the communication range of 200 meters.
- **Sudden Braking or Emergency Maneuvers:** If another vehicle rapidly decelerates or performs a sharp maneuver, the system will trigger an alert.
- **Vehicle Deceleration or Acceleration:** If the system detects significant changes in the vehicle's own movement due to a nearby hazard, it will trigger a warning.
- **Traffic Congestion or Incident Detection:** The system detects changes in traffic flow and alerts the driver about possible congestion or incidents in the vicinity.

**4. Execution Output:**  
- **Real-Time Alerts:** The system provides both visual and auditory alerts to warn the driver of potential hazards, such as sudden braking by a nearby vehicle or changes in traffic flow.
- **Data Exchange:** The system continuously exchanges data with nearby V2V-enabled vehicles, sharing current location, speed, and directional information to improve safety and awareness.
- **Hazard Identification:** If a nearby vehicle exhibits dangerous driving behavior (e.g., sudden stopping), the system will display a warning message on the vehicle’s dashboard and may activate haptic feedback (e.g., steering wheel vibrations) to further alert the driver.

**5. Exit Conditions:**  
- **Normal Operation Resumption:** Once the immediate threat has passed, the system will automatically return to regular monitoring mode, continuously sharing and receiving data with nearby vehicles.
- **Manual Deactivation:** The driver can deactivate the V2V system via the vehicle’s settings or infotainment system, halting communication with other vehicles.
- **Out-of-Range:** If the vehicle exits the communication range (200 meters) or encounters a signal failure, the system will automatically stop exchanging data, but continue searching for nearby V2V-enabled vehicles.
- **System Error:** In case of a failure in system functionality (e.g., communication module failure), the system will notify the driver and exit to a safe mode with basic functionality until service is performed.
