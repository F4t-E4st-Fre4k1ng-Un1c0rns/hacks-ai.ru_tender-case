Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration - Technical Specifications (Compliant)

**Functional Description**  
The Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration subsystem facilitates seamless communication between luxury electric vehicles, enabling the exchange of critical information such as vehicle speed, location, direction, and driver intentions. This subsystem aims to improve road safety by providing real-time alerts and assisting in collision avoidance. The system is designed to comply with industry standards for secure, scalable, and efficient communication between connected vehicles. It supports both cooperative safety features and traffic flow management, ensuring a reliable and responsive user experience.

**Enabling Conditions**  
- Vehicles must be equipped with a compatible V2V communication module that supports the latest communication protocols, including DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications) or C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything).
- The vehicle’s onboard network must support the integration of the V2V subsystem and ensure sufficient data throughput for communication with nearby vehicles.
- Vehicles should be running the latest version of the software, with regular updates for security patches and protocol improvements.
- The communication range must be at least 300 meters, with an unobstructed line of sight to ensure optimal performance.
- The system must be activated by default when the vehicle is powered on, and users can enable or disable V2V through the vehicle settings.

**Trigger Conditions**  
- The system triggers automatically when two or more V2V-enabled vehicles are detected within communication range.
- If a vehicle detects an obstacle, hazard, or sudden braking in the vicinity (from surrounding vehicles), the V2V system will trigger an alert to warn the driver.
- The system triggers when a vehicle enters a high-risk area, such as a busy intersection or a location with heavy congestion, and initiates real-time communication to optimize traffic flow.
- V2V communication is activated when a vehicle’s driver engages in specific maneuvers, such as turning on turn signals or initiating lane changes, to notify nearby vehicles of the change in driving intent.

**Execution Output**  
- The system transmits real-time data to the vehicle’s dashboard, displaying information on surrounding vehicles’ speeds, locations, and potential hazards.
- If a collision risk is detected, the system will issue an audio and visual warning to the driver, with a prompt to take corrective action, such as braking or steering.
- The V2V subsystem will notify the driver of the current traffic status, including upcoming slowdowns, red lights, or accidents ahead based on data from other vehicles.
- The system will generate a report of all data exchanges and alerts triggered during the vehicle's operation, accessible via the vehicle's infotainment system for later review.

**Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**  
- The system will exit if it detects a loss of communication with surrounding vehicles or if no vehicles are in range for data exchange. In this case, the system will notify the driver and continue normal operation with traditional safety systems.
- The V2V subsystem will automatically deactivate when the vehicle is turned off or when the user disables the feature through the vehicle settings.
- If a critical system error occurs (e.g., communication failure, hardware malfunction), the system will exit and display an error message indicating the need for maintenance or software update.
- The system will exit when the vehicle moves out of range from all compatible V2V-equipped vehicles or enters an environment where the signal is obstructed or blocked (e.g., tunnels or areas with heavy interference).
