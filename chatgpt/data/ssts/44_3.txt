**1. Title:**  
Automatic System Reset for Vehicle In-Car Tech

---

**2. Functional Description:**  
The Automatic System Reset feature is designed to automatically detect and resolve issues within the in-car technology systems, including the infotainment, navigation, and other connected components. When the system detects a malfunction or unresponsiveness in one of these components, it will trigger a reset process to restore functionality. The feature aims to minimize user intervention by addressing common software glitches or freezes, ensuring that in-car technology remains operational and providing a seamless user experience.

**3. Enabling Conditions:**  
- The Automatic System Reset functionality is enabled by default in all vehicles equipped with the required in-car technology systems (infotainment, navigation, etc.).  
- The system is compatible with the latest software update version and integrates with the vehicle’s diagnostic network to continuously monitor the health of the in-car tech systems.  
- Vehicles must be equipped with the necessary hardware to support software-based resets.  
- The system should be initialized and ready to detect failure states after the vehicle’s engine has been started and the in-car technology system is active.

**4. Trigger Conditions:**  
- The system will detect a malfunction or unresponsiveness in any connected in-car technology components, such as infotainment, navigation, or digital control systems.  
- Malfunctions may include software crashes, freezes, or inability to process user inputs (e.g., touchscreen unresponsiveness, system crashes).  
- The system may not trigger on non-software related issues (e.g., hardware malfunctions, power failures, or severe software corruption).

**5. Execution Output:**  
- Upon detection of a system failure, the Automatic System Reset will attempt to reset the affected in-car technology components.  
- The reset process will reboot the failed system and attempt to restore previous settings, including user preferences such as navigation route, media settings, and climate controls where applicable.  
- If the reset is successful, the in-car tech system will return to a fully functional state without requiring user intervention.  
- If user data (preferences, settings) cannot be restored, the system will revert to default settings.

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions:**  
- The system will exit the reset process once the malfunctioning component has been successfully restored to a functional state, and normal system operation has been resumed.  
- If the reset is unsuccessful, the system will prompt the user with an error message and suggest contacting customer support or visiting a service center for further diagnosis.  
- The system may enter a recovery mode if the failure persists, and in such cases, full functionality may not be restored until professional intervention occurs.
