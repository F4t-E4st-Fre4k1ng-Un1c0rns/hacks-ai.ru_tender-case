### 2. Functional Description  
The Seamless Transition Between In-Car and Smartphone Apps sub-system is designed to provide a smooth and uninterrupted user experience as users switch between their in-car infotainment system and their smartphone app. The system will support the transition of key vehicle functions, such as navigation, media control, climate settings, and diagnostics, ensuring no data loss or disruption. The sub-system will automatically detect when the user is transitioning between the car and smartphone and facilitate a seamless handover of the active session between the two devices.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The smartphone must be paired with the car’s infotainment system using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or another supported connectivity method.
- Both the car's infotainment system and the smartphone app must be running the latest version, ensuring compatibility with the sub-system's transition features.
- The user must have the official mobile app installed on the smartphone and be logged in with their account for seamless authentication.
- The car’s infotainment system must be equipped with the required software to detect the presence of the smartphone, either through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or similar technology.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The transition from the in-car infotainment system to the smartphone app will be triggered when the system detects that the user is exiting the car or when the smartphone is within the operational range of the in-car system (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi).
- The transition from the smartphone app to the in-car infotainment system will occur when the system detects the user re-entering the car and reconnecting to the in-car system.
- The user can manually initiate the transition via the infotainment system or smartphone app if needed, through a “hand-off” button or prompt.

### 5. Execution Output  
- When the transition is successful, the system will ensure that all active sessions, such as navigation, media playback, or climate control settings, are transferred seamlessly between the in-car system and the smartphone app without any interruption or data loss.
- If the transition is initiated from the car, the smartphone app will immediately prompt the user to continue the session. Once confirmed, the session will be resumed with all relevant settings intact.
- If the transition is initiated from the smartphone, the in-car system will automatically detect the user's presence and prompt them to continue the session in the car, resuming the previous state (e.g., active route, music playlist).
- In case of a failure during the transition (e.g., poor connectivity or device disconnection), an error message will be displayed to the user, advising them on troubleshooting steps.

---

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- Once the transition has occurred, the session on the previous device (whether in the car or on the smartphone) will be paused, and the active session will be fully transferred to the new device without any loss of data.
- The user can manually exit the session from either device, and the system will gracefully end the session on both platforms (e.g., stopping media playback, saving navigation data, or turning off the climate controls).
- If the user exits the session (via app or infotainment system), the system will ensure that all settings are saved to the cloud or local storage and will prompt the user to complete any necessary actions (e.g., confirming route completion in navigation) before closing the session.
