### 1. Title  
**Voice-Controlled Vehicle Settings Customization - Technical Specifications**

### 2. Functional Description  
The **Voice-Controlled Vehicle Settings Customization** sub-system enables users to control and personalize various vehicle settings through voice commands. This includes adjusting cabin temperature, seat position, music preferences, ambient lighting, and driving modes. The system is designed to enhance the driving experience by offering hands-free, voice-based control, allowing users to make adjustments safely and conveniently while driving. The system recognizes commands from pre-configured user profiles and delivers voice feedback confirming the successful adjustment of the settings.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle must be equipped with a microphone array, voice recognition software, and an active infotainment system that supports voice control.
- The system requires that the vehicle's voice profile is pre-configured with the user’s preferences, such as seat position, climate control, and media choices.
- The vehicle’s infotainment system must be connected to a stable power source and functioning at full capacity.
- The system must support multiple languages or dialects as required by the vehicle's region.
- A network connection is required for features like music streaming and real-time data synchronization (if applicable).
- The voice control system must be active, and the microphone must be in listening mode to detect commands.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The system is activated when a user issues a wake word (e.g., "Hey, [Vehicle Name]") or presses a dedicated button to initiate voice control.
- Voice commands related to vehicle settings, such as climate adjustments, seat positions, and media controls, will automatically trigger the system.
- The system is designed to respond to a variety of commands, including single or multiple settings changes (e.g., “Set temperature to 22°C and play my favorite playlist”).
- The system will engage when the vehicle is stationary or in motion, provided the necessary safety protocols are met.

### 5. Execution Output  
- Upon receiving a valid voice command, the system will adjust the corresponding vehicle settings, such as modifying cabin temperature, adjusting seat position, activating ambient lighting, or changing the driving mode.
- The system will provide verbal confirmation of the executed command (e.g., “Cabin temperature set to 22°C,” “Seat position adjusted to your preferences,” “Switching to Sport mode”).
- If a command is ambiguous or cannot be executed, the system will respond with a polite error message, prompting the user to repeat or clarify the request (e.g., “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. Could you repeat the command?”).
- In cases of successful command execution, the system may also provide visual confirmation on the infotainment screen (e.g., a visual update on the climate control, seat position, or media status).

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The system will automatically exit voice command mode after a command is successfully executed, and the user will return to the main vehicle interface.
- If no additional commands are issued within a predefined period (e.g., 5 minutes), the system will return to idle mode.
- The system will exit if the user explicitly says “Cancel” or “Exit,” or if the user disengages the voice control system via a manual input (e.g., pressing a button).
- In the case of a system error or failure to execute a command, the system will exit the current session and provide the user with instructions to troubleshoot or adjust settings manually.
- If a hardware malfunction or loss of connectivity occurs, the system will exit automatically and prompt the user to resolve the issue.
