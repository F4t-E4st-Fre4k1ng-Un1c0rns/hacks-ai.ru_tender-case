**Technical Specifications: Wireless Charging Station Integration for Electric Vehicles (EV)**

**2. Functional Description**  
The Wireless Charging Station Integration for Electric Vehicles (EV) is designed to provide an efficient, secure, and seamless charging experience for luxury electric vehicles. The system uses electromagnetic induction to wirelessly transfer energy between the charging station and the vehicle, eliminating the need for physical connectors. It ensures compatibility with the company’s luxury EV models and offers real-time charging data through a user-friendly mobile app or in-vehicle system interface. The system automatically adjusts charging power to optimize battery health and charging efficiency.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with a compatible wireless charging receiver that supports the charging frequencies and power specifications defined for the luxury EV models.
- The wireless charging station must be installed in a location with stable power supply and free from physical interference or obstruction that may affect signal transmission.
- The system requires internet access for initial setup and for communication with the mobile app or in-vehicle interface to monitor charging progress.
- The charging station and EV must comply with safety and electromagnetic field exposure standards in accordance with local regulatory requirements.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system automatically detects the presence of a compatible electric vehicle near the charging station.
- Upon detection, the system sends a wireless connection request to the vehicle’s receiver.
- The user must confirm the start of the charging process either through the mobile app or in-vehicle interface before energy transfer begins.
- The system initiates the charging process only when the vehicle’s battery is sufficiently low to initiate a charge, or the user manually overrides the battery’s state of charge.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Once the user confirms the start of charging, the system establishes a secure wireless connection, begins transferring energy, and displays real-time charging progress on the mobile app or in-vehicle system.
- The charging system dynamically adjusts power output based on the vehicle’s battery level to ensure optimal battery health, preventing overcharging and heat build-up.
- The system tracks energy usage and charging time, providing users with detailed metrics on energy consumed and time to full charge via the app or vehicle interface.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system stops transferring power when the vehicle reaches the preset charge level or when the user manually halts the process via the mobile app or vehicle interface.
- Upon completion of charging, the system alerts the user via mobile app or in-vehicle interface that the vehicle is fully charged.
- The system resets to its idle state, ready to detect and connect to a new vehicle for wireless charging.
