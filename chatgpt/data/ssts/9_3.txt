### 1. Title  
**Vehicle Data Analytics for Fleet Management**

---

### 2. Functional Description  
The **Vehicle Data Analytics for Fleet Management** sub-System is designed to provide fleet managers with insights into the performance, health, and efficiency of electric vehicles. The system collects telemetry data from fleet vehicles, processes it, and provides reports on vehicle health, energy consumption, route optimization, and maintenance needs. The key functions include predictive maintenance alerts, energy consumption tracking, and fleet performance reporting. However, some features are not fully optimized and may experience delays or inaccuracies in providing real-time insights.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- All vehicles in the fleet must be equipped with telemetry sensors (e.g., battery management systems, GPS, and performance tracking devices).
- The fleet management system must be integrated with the Vehicle Data Analytics sub-System, though some integration points may experience limited functionality.
- The fleet manager must have secure access to the dashboard to monitor and manage fleet performance data, although some user roles and permissions may not be fully configured.
- The system requires a stable network connection, but data synchronization may face occasional delays.
- Predictive maintenance and route optimization features are operational, though not fully optimized to consider all real-time variables (e.g., traffic or weather).

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- Telemetry data indicates a deviation from expected vehicle performance, such as issues with battery health or energy efficiency.
- A fleet manager manually requests a performance report or maintenance alert.
- Scheduled system syncs trigger updates from vehicles to the central system, although these may not always occur on time.
- Predictive maintenance is triggered based on vehicle data analysis, though the timing may be delayed due to system latency.
- Route and charging optimization tasks are triggered based on fleet configuration, but may not consider real-time data effectively.

### 5. Execution Output  
- **Fleet Performance Reports**: Summary reports on fleet-wide performance, including energy consumption, vehicle health, and maintenance costs. These reports may occasionally have missing data or outdated information due to system lag.
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Notifications related to predictive maintenance, such as upcoming part failures or required servicing. Alerts may sometimes be delayed or missed due to system inaccuracies.
- **Route and Charging Optimization**: Optimized routes and charging schedules based on fleet data, although real-time factors like weather or traffic may not always be accounted for.
- **Data Synchronization**: After each successful data sync, fleet information is updated, but delays may cause partial updates or missed data points.

---

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- **Successful Data Sync**: Data synchronization with vehicles occurs, but may be delayed or incomplete in some cases. The system confirms the update but may not provide the most current vehicle status.
- **Report Generation**: Fleet performance reports are generated, though some data gaps or inaccuracies may be present. The system outputs the report after processing the available data.
- **System Failure or Disconnection**: In case of connectivity issues, the system may fail to provide updates or maintenance alerts. The system will display an error message and recommend troubleshooting actions or retries.
