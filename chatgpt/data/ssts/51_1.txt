**Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring - Technical Specifications**

### 2. Functional Description  
The Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring sub-system is designed to monitor the vehicle's speed in real-time, compare it to the locally applicable speed limits, and provide timely alerts to the driver if the speed limit is exceeded. The system is integrated with the vehicle’s GPS and navigation modules to dynamically update speed limits as the vehicle moves through different geographical regions. The system ensures compliance with local speed regulations by providing both visual and audible feedback to the driver when exceeding speed limits, as well as positive reinforcement when within legal limits.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The sub-system must be integrated with the vehicle’s GPS and navigation systems for real-time speed limit detection.
- Active GPS connectivity is required to retrieve accurate, up-to-date speed limit data based on the vehicle’s location.
- The system must interface with the vehicle’s onboard display unit (e.g., dashboard or mobile app) to deliver visual and/or audible notifications to the user.
- The vehicle's speed sensors must be calibrated for accurate speed measurement.
- The system must support vehicle communication protocols to deliver timely alerts (audible, visual, or haptic feedback).
- The sub-system must be enabled through the vehicle's control settings (either through dashboard settings or mobile app).

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The system is triggered when the vehicle exceeds the speed limit by a predefined threshold (e.g., 5 km/h over the limit).
- The system detects a change in geographical location via GPS, prompting a speed limit update for the new region.
- A failure in GPS connectivity will trigger a notification alert to the user, indicating that speed limit data cannot be fetched at that moment.
- The system is triggered when the vehicle exceeds the legal speed limit and needs to issue an alert.

### 5. Execution Output  
- **Primary Output:** When the vehicle exceeds the speed limit, an immediate visual and/or audible alert is triggered. This could include a red flashing indicator on the dashboard and an audible warning sound.
- **Secondary Output:** When the vehicle is operating within the speed limit, the system provides a visual confirmation (e.g., green check mark or message) to reassure the driver that they are in compliance.
- **Fallback Output:** In case of GPS signal failure, the system displays a message notifying the driver of the issue, and may provide a default speed limit (e.g., 50 km/h) or cease location-based alerts until GPS is restored.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The system exits the alert mode when the vehicle’s speed is reduced to within the predefined legal limit. The alert is silenced, and positive feedback is provided.
- If the GPS signal is restored, the system resumes operation, updating the speed limit data to reflect the vehicle’s current location and providing alerts accordingly.
- When the vehicle comes to a stop (e.g., parked or at a traffic light), the system enters a dormant state, where no speed limit alerts are issued until the vehicle resumes movement.
