**Technical Specifications for Real-Time Parking Availability Notifications**

**1. Title**  
Real-Time Parking Availability Notifications

**2. Functional Description**  
The Real-Time Parking Availability Notifications sub-System is designed to provide users with real-time information on parking space availability near their current location. This system collects and processes real-time parking data to notify users about parking options, ensuring that they are informed about available spots as they approach their destination. In case initial parking options are unavailable, the system will suggest alternative locations, providing the user with a seamless parking experience. The feature can be accessed via the vehicle's infotainment system or a connected mobile application, offering data such as the distance to available spots, parking type, and availability status.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The user's vehicle is equipped with the necessary hardware and software to access and display real-time parking information.  
- The vehicle’s GPS system must be operational to determine the user's location with sufficient accuracy.  
- An active internet connection (via mobile data or Wi-Fi) is required to retrieve and update parking availability data.  
- The system must have access to an integrated parking data provider or external third-party service that supplies real-time parking availability information.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The user activates the parking notification feature from either the vehicle’s infotainment system or the connected mobile app.  
- The system detects the user’s destination and starts gathering real-time parking data for the area based on the user’s preferences (e.g., proximity, parking type).  
- The system will monitor parking availability continuously as the user approaches the destination. If a lack of available parking is detected, the system will trigger suggestions for alternative parking locations.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Notifications about parking availability, including distance, type, and status (e.g., full or available).  
- Information about specific parking restrictions, pricing, or time limitations, if available.  
- Suggestions for alternative parking locations if the initial parking options are unavailable.  
- Real-time updates on parking availability as the user nears the destination.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The user successfully parks the vehicle in a chosen parking spot, and the system records the parking details.  
- If no parking is available at the selected spot, the system exits by suggesting alternative nearby locations and updating the navigation route.  
- The system exits when the parking notification feature is deactivated or when the vehicle reaches the destination and the parking process is completed.  
- If the parking feature cannot retrieve data (e.g., due to connectivity issues), the system will notify the user and provide guidance on alternative options or recommend trying again later.
