Automatic Traffic Sign Recognition and Alerting - Technical Specifications

**Functional Description**  
The Automatic Traffic Sign Recognition and Alerting system is designed to autonomously detect and interpret traffic signs, providing the driver with real-time alerts regarding critical traffic information, such as speed limits, stop signs, yield signs, and other important road signs. The system relies on cameras, sensors, and advanced machine learning algorithms to scan the road environment and process visual data in real-time. Upon detection of a traffic sign, the system will generate immediate visual and/or audible notifications to inform the driver of the relevant sign. Alerts will vary based on the type of sign, with priority given to signs that require driver action (e.g., stop, yield, speed limits).

**Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with cameras, lidar, and/or other visual sensors capable of detecting and recognizing road signs in various lighting and weather conditions, including daytime, nighttime, rain, fog, and snow.
- The system requires an onboard computing unit capable of processing visual data from the sensors in real-time without significant delay.
- The system will be automatically activated when the vehicle starts, or it can be manually activated by the driver via the vehicle's central control interface.
- The system must be regularly updated through over-the-air (OTA) software updates to ensure recognition of new or modified traffic signs, changes in traffic laws, and improvements in detection algorithms.
- The system will rely on the vehicle's GPS system to correlate detected signs with map data for accuracy, particularly for recognizing newly installed or non-standard signs.

**Trigger Conditions**  
- The system will trigger when the vehicle enters a road segment with visible traffic signs within the detection range of the sensors (minimum detection range: 100 meters).
- The system will activate when a traffic sign enters the sensor’s field of view, and the sign meets the required recognition criteria (clear visibility, correct positioning, etc.).
- The system will provide a fallback alert if a sign is partially obscured, incorrectly positioned, or cannot be recognized due to poor visibility conditions (e.g., heavy fog or rain).
- If the system encounters a sign it cannot identify or categorize, it will trigger an error alert to the driver, indicating a possible malfunction or sign recognition failure.

**Execution Output**  
- The system will display the recognized traffic sign on the vehicle's dashboard screen, accompanied by relevant information (e.g., "Speed Limit 50 km/h", "Stop", "Yield").
- For signs that require immediate action, such as stop signs or speed limits, the system will generate an **audible alert** to immediately notify the driver, accompanied by a **visual alert** on the dashboard.
- The system will differentiate between critical signs (e.g., stop, yield, red light cameras) and informational signs (e.g., speed limits, cautionary warnings), adjusting the urgency and type of the alerts accordingly.
- If the system cannot recognize a sign, it will display an error message (e.g., "Sign Recognition Failed") and suggest that the driver proceed with caution until further signs are detected.
- All alerts and system status updates will be logged for diagnostic purposes, with the ability for the driver to view the most recent notifications.

**Exit Conditions**  
- The system will exit when the vehicle passes the detected traffic sign or the sign moves out of the detection range of the sensors (minimum detection range: 100 meters).
- The system will exit automatically when no traffic signs are detected within the vehicle’s path or field of view.
- If the system encounters a critical error (e.g., camera or sensor failure), it will deactivate, display an error message to the driver, and log the issue for maintenance.
- If the system determines that the current road conditions or visibility are too poor for accurate sign recognition (e.g., severe fog or snow), it will enter a **reduced functionality mode** where sign recognition is paused, and the driver is notified of this limitation.
