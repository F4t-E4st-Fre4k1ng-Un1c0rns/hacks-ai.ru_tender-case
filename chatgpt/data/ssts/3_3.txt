Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization – Technical Specifications

**Functional Description:**  
The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) System Customization allows the user to modify key settings such as following distance, speed tolerance, and response speed. The system adjusts these parameters based on user input, while also incorporating automatic adjustments in response to real-time traffic conditions. The system provides a balance between customization and automatic control, offering the driver a personalized experience while maintaining optimal safety and convenience. However, certain settings (like response speed) are automatically optimized by the system based on detected driving conditions, limiting user control.

**Enabling Conditions:**  
- The vehicle must have the ACC system installed and operational.
- The vehicle must be in drive mode with the engine running for ACC customization to be available.
- The vehicle’s sensors must be fully operational, with no malfunctions or obstructions affecting sensor performance.
- The driver must access the ACC customization settings via the vehicle’s infotainment system or steering wheel controls.
- The vehicle must be in an environment where the system is capable of detecting traffic, typically highway conditions or similar contexts.

**Trigger Conditions:**  
- The driver triggers the ACC customization menu by selecting the "ACC Customization" option within the vehicle’s infotainment system.
- The ACC customization menu is displayed automatically when the driver enters a highway driving environment or a similar context that is appropriate for ACC functionality.
- The system may also automatically suggest a review of customization options when specific conditions, such as sensor calibration, require user input.

**Execution Output:**  
- Upon adjusting settings, the system updates the ACC parameters, including following distance, speed tolerance, and response speed, based on the driver’s preferences.
- The customization changes are reflected immediately in the system, but certain adjustments may take a moment to fully apply.
- A confirmation message will be displayed on the screen to inform the driver that the settings have been updated successfully.
- If any sensor issues are detected during customization, the system will disable customization options and prompt the driver to resolve the issue.

**Exit Conditions:**  
- Once the customization settings are confirmed, the system applies the changes and exits the customization interface, returning to the main control screen.
- The user can now resume normal driving with the updated ACC settings in place.
- In case of errors or issues (such as sensor failure), the system will exit customization mode and may prompt the user to address the problem before returning to the main menu.
