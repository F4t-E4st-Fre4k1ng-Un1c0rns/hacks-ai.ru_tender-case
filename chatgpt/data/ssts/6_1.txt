**2. Functional Description**  
The Personalized Navigation System with Voice Commands provides a hands-free, intuitive navigation experience for users. By integrating voice recognition and real-time map data, it allows the user to input destinations, adjust routes, and request alternatives—all through voice commands. The system leverages personalized features based on the user's preferences and historical data, ensuring an optimized and smooth navigation experience. The system is also capable of processing complex commands, such as rerouting to avoid tolls or adding multiple stops, and provides step-by-step voice and visual directions.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system processes the user’s voice command and responds with verbal acknowledgment, such as “Navigating to [destination],” and displays the updated route on the screen.
- If a route modification is requested, the system recalculates the new path, avoiding specified conditions (e.g., tolls) and provides an updated ETA.
- The system displays and verbally suggests alternative routes based on real-time traffic data or user preferences.
- The system updates the route dynamically, providing continuous, real-time directions and offering step-by-step guidance with frequent updates about the user’s progress and estimated arrival time.
- When navigation is complete, the system verbally confirms the arrival at the destination, saying, “You have arrived at your destination.”

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system successfully guides the user to the desired destination and announces, “You have arrived at your destination.”
- The user manually ends the navigation by saying “End navigation,” at which point the system stops providing directions and voice prompts.
- If the system is unable to complete the navigation (e.g., due to a loss of GPS signal or lack of data), it provides a message like “Navigation interrupted. Please try again later” and offers alternative options for user input.
- Upon user request, the system exits navigation mode and switches to another function, such as the infotainment system or manual map controls.
