### 2. Functional Description  
The On-Demand Charging sub-system enables users to easily request and access charging services for electric vehicles (EVs). It allows users to select, schedule, and initiate charging at available stations within the network via a mobile application or vehicle interface. The system provides real-time information about station availability, charging progress, and completion. The system is capable of processing payments for charging services, sending notifications about session updates, and generating receipts. It is designed to optimize the charging experience by offering flexible charging options based on user preferences and vehicle requirements.

### 5. Execution Output  
- The system verifies the availability of the selected charging station and provides the user with an estimated start time for the session.
- Once the vehicle reaches the selected station, the system starts the charging process.
- During the charging session, the user receives real-time updates about the charging progress, including remaining time and energy input.
- If there are any issues, such as station unavailability or network problems, the system notifies the user and offers alternatives or rescheduling options.
- After the session is completed, the system processes the payment for the service and generates a receipt, which is sent to the user.
