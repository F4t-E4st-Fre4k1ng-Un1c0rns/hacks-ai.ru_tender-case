### 2. Functional Description  
The "Setting Geofences for Vehicle Tracking and Monitoring" sub-system allows users to create virtual geographic boundaries (geofences) around specific areas and monitor vehicles within those areas in real-time. Users can define and configure geofences using map tools or input coordinates. When a vehicle enters or exits a geofence, the system generates notifications and logs the event for tracking purposes. Additional trigger conditions such as vehicle speed or rapid geofence transitions can also be monitored. The system supports real-time updates, geofence event reports, and alerts for fleet management and security.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- Users must have appropriate access rights (admin or fleet manager role) to create, configure, and manage geofences.  
- The vehicle tracking platform must be integrated with GPS tracking devices for each vehicle to enable accurate location monitoring.  
- Vehicles must be active in the system with real-time location data enabled.  
- The user must be able to navigate and use the geofence creation tools, including map-based drawing or coordinate input.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- A vehicle enters or exits a predefined geofence boundary.  
- A vehicle exceeds the predefined speed limit within the geofence area.  
- A vehicle crosses multiple geofences within a specified time frame (rapid transitions).  
- The system detects a failure in GPS tracking or communication issues that could affect geofence monitoring.  
- A vehicle enters a restricted or no-entry geofence zone.

### 5. Execution Output  
- The system generates real-time notifications for the user when a vehicle enters or exits a geofence.  
- A log entry is created for each geofence event, including vehicle ID, geofence ID, timestamp, and action (entry/exit).  
- A visual update is shown on the map interface, confirming the creation or modification of geofences.  
- Alerts are triggered based on user-configured parameters (e.g., vehicle speed, entry/exit events, or boundary violations).  
- The system generates a report summarizing geofence events, including times and vehicle data.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The geofence is successfully created or modified, and it begins to monitor the designated vehicles.  
- Event logs and reports are available for review by the user, and alerts are sent according to the defined parameters.  
- If a failure occurs (e.g., invalid geofence coordinates or connectivity issues), the system will notify the user and prevent activation until the issue is resolved.  
- Geofence data is persisted in the system for future reference and management.
