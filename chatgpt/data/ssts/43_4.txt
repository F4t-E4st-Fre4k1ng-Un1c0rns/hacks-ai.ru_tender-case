**Title: Technical Specifications for Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations**

---

**1. Functional Description:**
The Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations sub-system is designed to monitor and track a vehicle's fuel consumption in real-time. It collects data from various sensors embedded in the vehicle (such as fuel level, speed, acceleration, and engine load) and provides the driver with personalized recommendations aimed at optimizing energy use and improving fuel efficiency. The system will offer insights into the driver’s behavior, suggesting improvements like smoother acceleration or reducing idle time. These recommendations will be dynamically adjusted based on individual driving habits and historical data, providing users with tailored feedback through the vehicle’s dashboard or a connected mobile app.

**2. Enabling Conditions:**
- The vehicle must be equipped with sensors for real-time fuel tracking (fuel consumption, speed, acceleration, etc.).
- The vehicle must support an onboard digital system that integrates with the Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations sub-system.
- The user must have an active account in the vehicle’s connected ecosystem (e.g., mobile app or cloud service) for personalized data storage and feedback.
- The vehicle must be in operational mode (ignition on or in motion) for the tracking feature to activate.
- A stable internet connection is required for syncing data and delivering real-time recommendations and updates to the user.
- The system must support both automatic and manual activation, allowing users to enable or disable the feature via the vehicle interface or mobile app.

**3. Trigger Conditions:**
- The Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations system is triggered when the vehicle is started and the ignition is on, or when the vehicle begins moving.
- The system can also be manually triggered by the user through the vehicle's interface or connected app (e.g., by selecting a "Fuel Efficiency" mode).
- If the system detects significant deviations from fuel-efficient driving (e.g., harsh acceleration or rapid deceleration), it will trigger a recommendation alert.
- Updates to recommendations are triggered automatically based on changes in the user’s driving patterns or when new data (e.g., weekly driving reports) is available.

**4. Execution Output:**
- The system displays real-time fuel consumption data, efficiency scores, and relevant driving metrics (e.g., average fuel consumption, current driving mode, and distance to next fuel refill) on the vehicle's dashboard or the connected mobile app.
- The system provides tailored recommendations for improving driving habits, such as reducing aggressive acceleration or maintaining a steady speed.
- The system will continuously update its recommendations based on real-time driving behavior, adjusting the feedback if improvements or regressions are observed.
- After a trip, the system generates a summary report, offering insights on the overall fuel efficiency of the trip, efficiency score, and personalized recommendations for the next trip.
- The user can access historical data and track their fuel efficiency trends over time through the app or vehicle interface, helping them to monitor long-term improvements.

**5. Exit Conditions:**
- The system will stop tracking fuel efficiency once the vehicle is turned off, or when the vehicle is stationary for an extended period (e.g., more than 30 minutes without motion).
- If the system detects a malfunction in the required sensors or a loss of connectivity (e.g., GPS or sensor failure), it will notify the user and temporarily disable the fuel efficiency tracking and recommendations features.
- The system will also exit when the user manually deactivates the feature via the app or vehicle interface, or when the system detects an inactive session (e.g., prolonged engine idle without movement).
- A post-trip summary will be generated and displayed to the user when the system exits, detailing fuel consumption, efficiency scores, and suggestions for future improvements.
