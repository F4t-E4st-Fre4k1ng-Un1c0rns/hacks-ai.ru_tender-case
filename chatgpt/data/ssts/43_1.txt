**Technical Specifications: Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations**

1. **Title**  
   Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations – Technical Specifications

2. **Functional Description**  
   The Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations sub-System monitors energy consumption in luxury electric vehicles by tracking real-time driving behavior, including acceleration, braking, and speed patterns. Based on this data, it provides personalized recommendations to optimize energy usage, reduce consumption, and increase driving range. The system generates detailed efficiency reports after each trip and delivers periodic insights on how users can improve their fuel efficiency. The system aims to maximize vehicle range and ensure more sustainable driving practices.

3. **Enabling Conditions**  
   - The vehicle must be equipped with a compatible onboard telematics system that tracks energy consumption and driving behavior in real-time.
   - The sub-System requires access to vehicle data from the central control unit, including information on speed, acceleration, braking, energy consumption, and route data.
   - The user must opt-in to allow the system to collect driving data and provide efficiency recommendations.
   - A stable internet connection must be available for cloud-based data analysis and the retrieval of recommendations.
   - The vehicle’s energy management system must be operational, with data shared in an API-compatible format.

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - The system is triggered when the vehicle is started and the user navigates to the "Fuel Efficiency" section in the dashboard interface.
   - The system can be manually triggered by the user when they select "View Recommendations" or request an efficiency report.
   - A trigger will also occur if the system detects significant deviations in driving behavior, such as rapid acceleration or excessive braking, prompting an immediate recommendation.
   - The system will periodically (e.g., weekly) trigger automated recommendations based on accumulated data about the user's driving habits.

5. **Execution Output**  
   - The system displays a report showing the vehicle’s current energy consumption, average efficiency, and overall performance compared to previous trips.
   - Personalized recommendations are provided, such as reducing rapid acceleration or maintaining a steady speed, with the aim to optimize energy usage.
   - At the end of each trip, the system provides a summary that includes the total energy consumed, the range achieved, and the efficiency compared to previous trips.
   - Notifications alert the user to any significant changes in energy consumption or driving behavior, offering suggestions for improvement.
   - The system displays graphical representations of efficiency trends, highlighting areas for improvement over time.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - The system exits the Fuel Efficiency Tracking session when the user finishes reviewing the efficiency data and closes the application or navigation screen.
   - When the vehicle is turned off, the sub-System automatically halts monitoring and saving of real-time data until the vehicle is started again.
   - All performance data, including efficiency reports and recommendations, is automatically saved to the user’s profile for future reference.
   - If the system encounters a technical issue (e.g., loss of connection to vehicle telemetry), the sub-System will display a clear error message and log the issue for resolution. The user will be notified when the issue is resolved and the system is back online.
