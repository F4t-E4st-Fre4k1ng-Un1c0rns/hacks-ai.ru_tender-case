---

**2. Functional Description**

The In-Car Payment System Integration for Toll and Parking enables automated payment for tolls and parking charges directly from the vehicle’s in-car system. The system supports multiple payment methods, including credit/debit cards, RFID, and digital wallets. It is designed to interact with compatible toll booths, parking gates, and digital payment infrastructures, enabling the vehicle to calculate and process payments without requiring manual interaction from the driver. The system provides the option to choose from various payment methods, and delivers payment confirmation and digital receipts directly on the vehicle's dashboard.

**3. Enabling Conditions**

- The vehicle must be equipped with a functional infotainment system, with active internet connectivity or communication interfaces (e.g., NFC, Bluetooth, GPS) to interact with toll or parking infrastructure.
- The system must be linked to an active user payment account (credit/debit card, digital wallet, or prepaid account), allowing for automated payment processing.
- The vehicle’s system must support the integration of standard communication protocols used by toll and parking systems, such as RFID, mobile payment APIs, or toll collection standards.
- The vehicle must have the latest software updates that support security, payment protocols, and system compatibility with various toll and parking infrastructure.
- The toll or parking facility must support electronic payment methods compatible with the vehicle’s payment system.

**4. Trigger Conditions**

- The system is activated when the vehicle approaches a toll booth or parking gate and detects the presence of an electronic payment system.
- The system may also be triggered when the user manually selects the "Payment" option in the vehicle's dashboard interface, in cases where automatic detection fails.
- If the system detects a valid toll or parking fee, it triggers the payment process by initiating communication with the payment infrastructure.
- In cases of failure to detect compatible payment infrastructure, the system will display an error message and may prompt the driver to manually complete the transaction or select an alternative payment method.

**5. Execution Output**

- Once triggered, the system processes the payment according to the selected method (e.g., credit card, wallet, prepaid account).
- Upon successful payment, the vehicle communicates with the toll or parking infrastructure, raising the barrier or granting access.
- A digital receipt is generated and displayed on the vehicle’s dashboard, confirming the transaction and the payment amount.
- If payment fails, an error message is displayed, and the system offers the option to attempt manual payment or contact support for assistance.
- In the case of infrastructure compatibility issues, the system logs the failure for review and informs the user of the issue.

**6. Exit Conditions**

- The exit condition is met when the payment is successfully processed, and the toll or parking barrier is raised or the vehicle is granted access.
- A transaction receipt is displayed on the dashboard, providing confirmation of the completed payment.
- The user can continue driving or park as needed after payment confirmation.
- If payment is unsuccessful, the vehicle will notify the driver with instructions for resolving the issue (e.g., attempt manual payment, contact customer service).
- After a payment failure, the system logs the transaction attempt, including any issues encountered, for future reference and troubleshooting.
