**Technical Specifications: Automatic System Reset for Vehicle In-Car Tech**

### 1. Title  
**Automatic System Reset for Vehicle In-Car Tech**

### 2. Functional Description  
The Automatic System Reset for Vehicle In-Car Tech is a subsystem designed to autonomously detect failures within the vehicle's in-car technology and initiate an automatic reset of the affected system modules. Upon detecting a malfunction, the subsystem will perform a system check and execute a reset, ensuring minimal disruption to the user. If the reset process fails, the subsystem will enter a recovery mode, allowing for basic functionality to be maintained until the issue can be further addressed. Error logs will be created for diagnostic purposes, enabling future analysis of recurring issues.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle must be powered on and operational.
- The in-car technology system must be initialized and actively functioning.
- The vehicle's firmware must be updated to the latest version.
- The user must have enabled automatic diagnostics and reset features during the initial vehicle setup process.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- A failure is detected in any of the core in-car tech modules, such as infotainment, navigation, or climate control.
- The system fails to receive user input or interaction within a predefined timeout period (e.g., 30 seconds of unresponsiveness).
- A critical error is detected, indicating that a reset is necessary to restore functionality.

### 5. Execution Output  
- **Primary Output**: The affected system component (e.g., infotainment or climate control) is automatically reset, restoring normal functionality within a few seconds.
- **Secondary Output**: If the reset fails, the system enters a recovery mode, providing basic functionality such as navigation or audio, and the user is notified of the issue.
- Error logs are generated for diagnostic purposes, recording the reset attempt and failure if applicable.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- **Successful Reset**: The affected system module is fully functional, and the in-car technology is restored to its normal state.
- **Recovery Mode**: If the reset fails, the system enters recovery mode, offering limited functionality while the user is notified and error logs are created for future review.
