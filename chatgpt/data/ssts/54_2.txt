### 1. Title  
Automatic Traffic Sign Recognition and Alerting

---

### 2. Functional Description  
The **Automatic Traffic Sign Recognition and Alerting** sub-system is designed to detect and interpret road traffic signs using high-resolution cameras and advanced computer vision algorithms. The system alerts the driver of detected signs, such as speed limits, stop signs, yield signs, and other relevant traffic signs. Alerts are provided via visual indicators on the dashboard and optional auditory signals to ensure the driver remains aware of changing traffic regulations. The system operates in real-time and is intended to improve driver safety by ensuring timely and accurate information is available during driving.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle is equipped with high-definition cameras and sensors that support the recognition of traffic signs.
- The system is enabled through the vehicle’s settings interface, ensuring it is active during operation.
- The system is compatible with the latest firmware and software updates, which should be installed to ensure optimal performance.
- Clear road conditions and unobstructed views for the cameras and sensors are required for accurate detection.
- The geographical area must include standard road signs that are recognized by the system.
- The system’s database must be regularly updated to recognize a wide array of regional and international traffic signs.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The system automatically activates when the vehicle begins moving and detects the presence of traffic signs within its sensor range.
- The system is re-triggered when new traffic signs are detected on the road or when the vehicle changes lanes or routes, leading to new signs within view.
- A system reset or initialization will trigger the reactivation of the sign recognition feature.

### 5. Execution Output  
- Upon detection of a traffic sign, the system generates the following outputs:
  - **Visual Alert:** A visual representation of the detected traffic sign, displayed on the vehicle’s dashboard or heads-up display (e.g., speed limit or stop sign icon).
  - **Auditory Alert (optional):** A clear, attention-grabbing sound (e.g., a beep or spoken announcement) for critical signs such as speed limits, stop signs, or yield signs.
  - **Driver Feedback:** If integrated with other vehicle systems (e.g., adaptive cruise control), the system may automatically adjust the vehicle’s speed or alert the driver to take action.
- The system may provide additional contextual information on the detected sign, such as the numerical value of the speed limit or direction-related instructions.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The system exits alert mode once the driver acknowledges the information provided (e.g., adjusting speed based on the detected sign).
- If no new traffic signs are detected for a specified period or if the road environment changes (e.g., road sign visibility is lost), the system reverts to idle mode.
- The system will deactivate or temporarily suspend operation in case of sensor or hardware malfunction, environmental interference (e.g., heavy rain or fog), or when road signs are no longer detectable.
- Once the system returns to normal operation after temporary suspension, it resumes detecting and alerting the driver to new traffic signs.
