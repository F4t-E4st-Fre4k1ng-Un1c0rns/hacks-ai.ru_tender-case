### 2. Functional Description
The In-Vehicle Cloud Storage system enables users to securely access and manage cloud-based personal data and media from within the vehicle. This includes storing, retrieving, and playing media files and adjusting user settings that sync with the cloud. The system provides basic file-based authentication and supports streaming where connection speeds allow. Playback reverts to downloaded files in areas with low network connectivity. User settings, preferences, and playlists are accessible within storage capacity limits.
