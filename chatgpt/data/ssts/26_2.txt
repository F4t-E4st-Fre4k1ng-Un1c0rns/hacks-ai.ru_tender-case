**2. Functional Description:**

The Remote Engine Start/Stop via Mobile App sub-system enables users to remotely control their vehicle’s engine through a mobile application. This feature provides the ability to start or stop the vehicle’s engine from a distance, enhancing convenience and control over the vehicle’s operation. It ensures that the vehicle can be remotely activated to warm up or cool down, or powered off if the user forgot to turn it off when leaving the vehicle. The system interfaces with the vehicle's onboard electronics to communicate engine status updates and allows the user to manage this feature securely through the mobile app.
