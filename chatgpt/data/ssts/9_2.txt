**Technical Specifications for Vehicle Data Analytics for Fleet Management**

**1. Title:**
Vehicle Data Analytics for Fleet Management

**2. Functional Description:**
The Vehicle Data Analytics for Fleet Management sub-system is designed to provide fleet managers with advanced tools for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing the performance of luxury electric vehicles. This system collects and processes real-time data from each vehicle, focusing on key metrics such as battery status, driving behavior, maintenance needs, and location. The system presents these insights in a user-friendly dashboard that enables the fleet manager to make informed decisions regarding maintenance, vehicle deployment, and operational efficiency. It supports alerts for critical events, such as battery depletion or upcoming maintenance, and generates comprehensive reports to help with decision-making.

Key features:
- Real-time data collection and transmission from each vehicle in the fleet.
- Analysis of vehicle health, driving patterns, and usage trends.
- Customizable alerts for maintenance, battery status, and performance anomalies.
- Fleet management dashboard displaying key metrics for decision support.
- Automatic reporting and exportable data formats (e.g., CSV, PDF) for record-keeping and analysis.

**3. Enabling Conditions:**
- A stable internet connection for continuous data synchronization between vehicles and the sub-system.
- Each vehicle in the fleet must be equipped with compatible sensors (GPS, battery health monitors, etc.) that can transmit data to the system.
- Fleet managers must have authorized user credentials and access to the system’s dashboard interface, which may be accessed via desktop or mobile devices.
- The system must integrate with any existing fleet management software or platforms to ensure smooth data exchange.
- Vehicles must be configured to continuously transmit data, including telemetry, diagnostic information, and location data, to the sub-system.

**4. Trigger Conditions:**
- Data collection begins automatically when a vehicle is powered on and starts moving, transmitting real-time data to the sub-system.
- The system triggers maintenance alerts when predefined thresholds (e.g., battery below a certain level, scheduled maintenance due) are reached.
- The system triggers alerts for abnormal vehicle behavior (e.g., sharp acceleration or braking) based on data analysis and set parameters.
- The dashboard updates automatically every 5 minutes to reflect the latest data for each vehicle.
- The fleet manager can manually trigger a data refresh or request a detailed analysis for specific vehicles or fleet-wide performance metrics.

**5. Execution Output:**
- The system outputs real-time and historical performance data for each vehicle, including battery status, fuel efficiency, health reports, driving behavior, and vehicle location.
- Fleet managers will see an interactive dashboard with graphical representations of key metrics such as vehicle health scores, driving patterns, and maintenance schedules.
- The system generates alerts for issues requiring immediate attention, such as low battery or upcoming scheduled maintenance.
- Detailed reports can be exported in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF) for record-keeping, further analysis, or sharing with other team members.
- Actionable insights, including recommendations for optimizing fleet performance or reducing maintenance costs, are displayed in the dashboard and available for review.

**6. Exit Conditions:**
- The user exits the system when logging out, either after completing a fleet review session or after taking the necessary actions based on the data presented.
- If the system experiences a technical issue, the user is notified of the failure and can exit the system or wait for recovery. During such interruptions, the system will display a message outlining the issue and the expected time for resolution.
- The system exits automatically after presenting all necessary data and after the fleet manager acknowledges or acts upon any critical alerts.
- If the data collection process is interrupted due to loss of connectivity or sensor failure, the system exits with an error notification and prompts the user to take corrective action.
- The system will also allow users to exit or pause the analysis if manual intervention or data correction is required (e.g., recalibration of sensors or system settings).
