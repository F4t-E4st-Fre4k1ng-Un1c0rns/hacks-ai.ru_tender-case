Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance) Technical Specifications

**2. Functional Description**  
The Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance) is designed to autonomously assist the driver in parking the vehicle in various parking scenarios, including parallel, perpendicular, and garage parking. The system utilizes a combination of sensors, cameras, and software algorithms to detect available parking spaces, calculate optimal parking maneuvers, and automatically control the steering, braking, acceleration, and gear shifts to park the vehicle safely. The system allows the driver to monitor the parking process and intervene if necessary. This system supports seamless integration with other vehicle systems, such as the vehicle's infotainment display, which provides real-time feedback to the driver.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle is equipped with necessary sensors, including ultrasonic sensors, radar, and cameras for detecting obstacles, parking lines, and available spaces.
- The vehicle’s electrical system must be operational with sufficient battery charge to run the system during parking operations.
- The parking environment should have clear, unobstructed parking spaces with clearly defined boundaries for the system to identify (e.g., no large objects blocking the parking space).
- The vehicle must be in a fully operational mode with the engine on, and the driver must be seated with the seatbelt fastened.
- The system requires an active connection to the vehicle’s internal computer system to access control of the steering, braking, and acceleration systems.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is triggered when the driver activates the parking mode, either by pressing the parking button in the vehicle's interface or through voice command.
- The system automatically initiates when the vehicle is within a specified proximity of an identified parking space.
- The system will begin its operations once the vehicle has slowed to a predetermined speed (typically under 10 km/h) and enters the parking area.
- A valid parking space must be detected within a reasonable distance and with clear boundaries for the system to engage.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system outputs real-time feedback to the infotainment display, showing a visual representation of the parking space and the vehicle’s movement.
- The system autonomously controls the steering, braking, and acceleration of the vehicle to park it correctly within the parking space.
- The system generates auditory cues (e.g., beeping sounds) to indicate proximity to obstacles or boundaries during the parking process.
- After successfully completing the parking process, the system will display a confirmation message on the infotainment screen, signaling that the vehicle is parked correctly.
- The system will monitor the surrounding environment and adjust the parking maneuver to ensure the vehicle does not collide with objects or other vehicles.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system exits the parking mode once the vehicle is parked within the defined parking space and all necessary maneuvers (steering, braking, and gear shifting) are completed successfully.
- The system will exit automatically if the parking process is interrupted by a sensor failure, obstruction, or if the system detects an issue that prevents safe parking. The driver will be notified via the infotainment system or a visual alert.
- The system will also exit if the driver manually intervenes during the parking process (e.g., by pressing the brake pedal or disengaging the system).
- If the system detects that the parking space is no longer available (e.g., the space becomes blocked by another vehicle), the system will exit the operation and prompt the driver to find a new space.
