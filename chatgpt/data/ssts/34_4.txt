   Integration of Third-Party Apps into Car Infotainment System

2. **Functional Description**  
   The sub-system enables the integration of third-party applications into the car's infotainment system, allowing users to access, control, and interact with various external services such as music streaming, navigation, and social media apps. Users can launch these apps via the infotainment interface, control them using touch, voice commands, or steering wheel controls. While the system supports a variety of apps, there are instances of limited functionality, connectivity issues, or delays in performance due to API or network limitations. The sub-system is designed to provide basic functionality but may experience occasional errors or reduced responsiveness.

3. **Enabling Conditions**  
   - The infotainment system must be running a compatible version of its operating system, with support for third-party app integration.
   - The car has internet connectivity, either through the vehicle’s own network or through a mobile hotspot.
   - The third-party apps must be pre-approved and integrated into the system, although not all app features are guaranteed to work seamlessly.
   - The user must have a compatible mobile device or account linked to the infotainment system for app authentication and access.
   - The system will require periodic updates to ensure compatibility with new app versions, but the latest version of the software may not always be installed.

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - The user activates the infotainment system and selects the "Apps" menu to access third-party applications.
   - The user attempts to launch a third-party app either through their mobile device or cloud service connected to the car's infotainment system.
   - The system detects that the user is trying to interact with a third-party app and establishes a connection via the car's internet or mobile network.

5. **Execution Output**  
   - The third-party app is launched and its interface is displayed on the infotainment screen, though some features may not function fully.
   - Users can interact with the app’s basic features, such as playing music, receiving navigation instructions, or viewing social media updates, but advanced features or controls may not always be accessible.
   - The system provides user feedback, such as error messages or connectivity alerts, if the app fails to load or experiences performance issues.
   - Voice commands or touch controls may not always be responsive, and users may experience delays or errors in their interactions with the app.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - The user successfully exits the app by returning to the home screen or selecting a different app.
   - If the app becomes unresponsive, the user is prompted with an error message and given the option to retry, restart the app, or switch to another app.
   - The system will automatically exit or close the app if a critical error or connectivity failure occurs, and the user is returned to the main menu or another app interface.
