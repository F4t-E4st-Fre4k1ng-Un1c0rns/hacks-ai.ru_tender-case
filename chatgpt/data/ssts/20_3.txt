**Technical Specifications for Integrating Emergency Alerts in Vehicle Dashboard**

**1. Title**  
Integrating Emergency Alerts in Vehicle Dashboard

**2. Functional Description**  
The "Integrating Emergency Alerts in Vehicle Dashboard" sub-system provides real-time notifications of emergency situations directly on the vehicle's dashboard. These alerts are triggered by various onboard sensors and safety systems, such as collision detection, tire pressure monitoring, or malfunction indicators. The alerts are displayed as visual notifications, accompanied by an optional audible sound, ensuring the driver’s immediate attention. The system is also capable of connecting to external services to escalate the emergency if needed, though its full functionality may depend on connectivity availability.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary sensors for detecting emergencies, including but not limited to collision detection, tire pressure sensors, and airbag status.
- The vehicle's infotainment system must be operational and powered on.
- An active vehicle network connection is required for external emergency alert functionality (e.g., communication with emergency services or connected devices).
- The vehicle must be in an operational state (engine running) for the alert system to function.
- Driver and passenger safety features (e.g., airbags) must be installed and functional to trigger related alerts.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- A collision or significant impact detected by the onboard sensors.
- An abnormal change in tire pressure, signaling a potential failure or hazard.
- Activation of airbags or other safety mechanisms.
- Malfunction or fault detected in critical vehicle systems, such as engine overheating, brake failure, or electrical malfunction.
- When external connectivity is available, real-time emergency alerts may also be triggered by external factors, such as severe weather warnings or road incidents, if integrated.

**5. Execution Output**  
- A visual warning is displayed on the vehicle’s dashboard, such as a flashing icon or message indicating the type of emergency.
- An audible alarm is triggered to alert the driver of the emergency condition.
- The dashboard may provide additional information or instructions on how to handle the emergency, such as "slow down" or "pull over."
- If the system is connected to external services, a notification may be sent to emergency responders or a mobile app, depending on the configuration.
- The system will continuously display the alert until it is acknowledged by the driver or the emergency condition is resolved.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system exits when the emergency situation is resolved, either automatically (e.g., when tire pressure returns to normal or a collision alert ends) or when the emergency is cleared manually (e.g., driver acknowledges the alert).
- If the system detects a failure in the alert mechanism (e.g., sensor malfunction), it will display a failure notification on the dashboard, indicating that the emergency alert system is temporarily disabled.
- The alert remains on the dashboard until the driver takes action or the emergency is resolved. If the emergency condition persists, the system may continue to show the alert or provide instructions for manual intervention.
- In case of a prolonged unresolved issue, the system may escalate the alert to external emergency services or suggest that the driver take alternative safety measures.
