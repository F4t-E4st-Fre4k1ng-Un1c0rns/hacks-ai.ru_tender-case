**Technical Specifications for Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control Sub-System**

**1. Title**  
Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control

**2. Functional Description**  
The Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control sub-system is responsible for automatically identifying authorized drivers and granting access to the vehicle. The system uses biometric recognition (such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning) or RFID technology to authenticate the driver. Upon successful identification, the system unlocks the vehicle and enables the ignition. All access events are securely logged for audit purposes, providing traceable information for security.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The system must be equipped with biometric scanning or RFID technology to detect and identify the driver.
- The driver must be pre-registered in the system with valid biometric or RFID credentials.
- The vehicle must have an integrated system capable of interfacing with the Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control system.
- The vehicle must have sensors or proximity detectors to detect the driver’s presence and initiate the identification process.
- A reliable power source must be available for the system to function continuously during vehicle operation.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is activated when a registered driver approaches the vehicle within the detection range of the biometric scanner or RFID reader.
- The system scans for biometric data or RFID credentials once the driver enters the proximity detection range.
- The system will continuously check for the presence of a valid driver to authenticate access.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Upon successful driver identification, the system unlocks the vehicle doors and allows the driver to start the vehicle.
- A secure log entry is created, capturing the driver's details, time, and event for security auditing purposes.
- If identification fails, the system will prompt the driver to attempt an alternative identification method, such as entering a PIN or re-scanning biometric data.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- Once the vehicle is turned off or the driver exits the vehicle, the system deactivates the access control, logging the session exit.
- In the event of repeated identification failure, the system will enter a fail-safe mode and deny further access until the issue is addressed (such as manual unlocking or system support).
- The system exits the operational mode once the access session is completed, either by turning off the vehicle or when the driver moves away from the detection range.
