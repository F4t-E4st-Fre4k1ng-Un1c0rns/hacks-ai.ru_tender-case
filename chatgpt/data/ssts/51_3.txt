### Technical Specifications: Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring

#### 1. Title  
**Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring - Technical Specifications**

#### 2. Functional Description  
The Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring sub-system provides real-time monitoring of vehicle speed in relation to the local speed limits. It uses GPS data to detect the vehicle's current location and retrieves the appropriate speed limit for the area. If the vehicle exceeds the limit, visual and auditory alerts are triggered to notify the driver and encourage compliance. The system logs all compliance events and generates reports, which can be accessed by the driver or fleet managers. The system is designed to function as a semi-integrated module, with some dependency on manual reporting and GPS accuracy.

#### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle must be equipped with an active GPS system capable of determining the current location within a specified accuracy.
- The vehicle must have a speed sensor to monitor the current vehicle speed.
- The system must be connected to a display interface capable of showing speed limit data and alert notifications (e.g., dashboard display or infotainment screen).
- The system requires access to up-to-date regional speed limit data (via a digital map or similar data source).
- The system must be configured to start automatically upon vehicle ignition or driver activation through the interface.
- The driver must have agreed to use speed limit monitoring during the initial vehicle setup and enabled necessary system settings.

#### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The vehicle is started, or the ignition is engaged, activating the sub-system.
- The GPS system identifies the vehicle’s location and determines the applicable speed limit for the area.
- The vehicle’s speed exceeds the set threshold relative to the current speed limit (e.g., 5 km/h over the limit).
- GPS data is restored after a period of signal loss, allowing the system to resume speed limit monitoring.
- The system detects a potential fault in the GPS signal or data feed and switches to a default mode of only monitoring speed without speed limit alerts.

#### 5. Execution Output  
- A visual display of the current speed limit is shown on the vehicle’s dashboard or infotainment screen, updated in real time based on GPS data.
- If the vehicle exceeds the speed limit by the defined threshold, an auditory warning (e.g., beeping sound) and visual warning (e.g., flashing speed limit icon) are triggered.
- The system logs every instance where the vehicle exceeds the speed limit, including the duration of the violation and the severity (e.g., speed overage by a certain km/h).
- The system generates compliance reports that can be accessed by the driver or fleet manager through the vehicle’s interface or via an external data sync. The report includes details such as time, location, and speed limit compliance.
- In the event of a GPS signal loss, the system logs the event and switches to a monitoring mode without displaying or alerting to local speed limits until GPS data is restored.

#### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The vehicle is turned off or the ignition is disengaged, deactivating the sub-system.
- The vehicle returns to compliance with the local speed limit, causing the system to cease further alerts.
- The system completes its logging cycle at the end of a driving session or when the vehicle is parked for a prolonged period.
- If the GPS signal remains unavailable for an extended period, the system halts speed limit monitoring until the GPS signal is restored.
- The driver manually disables or resets the sub-system, ending the compliance monitoring session.
