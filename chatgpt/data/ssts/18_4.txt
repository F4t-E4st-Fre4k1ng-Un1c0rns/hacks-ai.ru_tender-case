**1. Title**  
Customizable Seat Position and Memory System - Technical Specifications

**2. Functional Description**  
The Customizable Seat Position and Memory System allows users to adjust their seat position according to personal preferences and saves these settings to be automatically recalled for future use. The system supports multiple user profiles and ensures the seat adjusts to the correct position upon vehicle entry. The system includes:
- Full control over seat adjustments (forward/backward, height, tilt, lumbar support).
- The ability to save multiple seat position profiles for different users (e.g., Driver 1, Driver 2).
- Automatic seat position recall based on user profile selection.
- The option for users to overwrite previously saved seat positions.
- Integration with the vehicle’s infotainment or seat control interface for a seamless user experience.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary seat adjustment hardware, including motors and sensors for forward/backward, height, tilt, and lumbar support.
- The system must support multiple user profiles, each associated with a unique seat position configuration.
- The vehicle’s infotainment or seat control system must be properly integrated with the seat memory functionality, ensuring seamless profile selection and seat adjustment.
- The seat memory system must be activated and functional upon vehicle startup, with no additional configuration required after initial setup.
- The system must ensure proper calibration of seat components to respond accurately to user inputs.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
The following events trigger the activation of the Customizable Seat Position and Memory System:
- A user enters the vehicle and selects their user profile either manually or automatically (via a linked key fob or biometric recognition).
- The ignition or power system is turned on, initializing the seat memory system.
- A user presses a button or selects an option from the infotainment system to recall a saved seat position linked to their profile.
- A user manually adjusts the seat and selects the option to save the new position, updating their profile.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system adjusts the seat position according to the saved preferences for the selected user profile, including adjustments for forward/backward, height, tilt, and lumbar support.
- If no saved seat position exists for the selected profile, the system will default to an initial seat position or allow the user to adjust the seat manually and save it for future use.
- The seat position recall function will ensure that the seat is returned to the saved configuration automatically upon profile selection, without additional input from the user.
- Any manual adjustments made by the user will be saved to the profile, overwriting the previous seat position if necessary.
- The system will display confirmation that the seat position has been successfully saved or recalled.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
The system exits the active state under the following conditions:
- The vehicle ignition is turned off, or the user exits the vehicle, deactivating the seat memory system.
- The user switches to a different profile, in which case the seat adjusts according to the new profile’s settings.
- A system failure occurs, preventing the seat from adjusting correctly. In this case, the system will lock the seat in its last known position until manual intervention is available.
- The user deletes or modifies their profile, causing any saved seat positions to be either deleted or updated based on the changes made.
