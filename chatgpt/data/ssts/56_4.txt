Technical Specifications for In-Vehicle Cloud Storage for Personal Data and Music  

---

**Functional Description:**  
The In-Vehicle Cloud Storage sub-system enables users to store and access personal data, such as music playlists and preference settings, within the vehicle’s onboard interface. This data is synchronized across compatible vehicles through limited cloud interaction, allowing for a personalized experience when connectivity conditions permit. User data may be cached locally to provide access when cloud connectivity is unavailable.   

---

**Enabling Conditions:**  
1. The vehicle must have a functional cloud connection interface capable of occasional remote data access.
2. User profiles must be set up within the vehicle’s onboard system; registration with an external cloud storage service is optional.
3. The cloud connection initiates only when the vehicle ignition is on and a high-speed network connection is detected.

---

**Trigger Conditions:**  
1. A cloud sync request is initiated when a user logs into their vehicle profile or manually selects data sync options.
2. Data changes, such as updated music preferences or personal settings, are saved locally and queued for cloud synchronization when connectivity is available.
3. The system only attempts syncing when stable, high-speed internet is accessible.

**Execution Output:**  
- Personal settings and media preferences are loaded from the most recent locally cached data.
- Updates to user data or playlists are saved locally, and queued for upload to cloud storage when favorable connection conditions are met.

**Exit Conditions:**  
1. The system completes data retrieval or sync only when user action is manually triggered.
2. Cloud synchronization is limited to on-demand and queued processes; data may remain locally cached until a stable connection is restored.
3. The user’s session closes with data stored locally, with queued syncs pending reconnection to high-speed network access.
