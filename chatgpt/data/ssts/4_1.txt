1. **Title**  
   User Preferences Management for Infotainment System - Version 1.0

2. **Functional Description**  
   The User Preferences Management subsystem allows users to configure, store, and retrieve personal settings within the infotainment system of a luxury electric vehicle. This subsystem will manage user preferences for a variety of settings, including seat position, audio volume, navigation settings, climate control preferences, and display configurations. The system will store user data in a secure profile and automatically load the saved preferences upon user login. It is designed to interact seamlessly with the car’s other subsystems, such as seating, audio, and climate control, ensuring an integrated user experience.

3. **Enabling Conditions**  
   - The infotainment system must be powered on and fully functional.
   - The user must be logged into the infotainment system using a valid, unique profile.
   - The system must be connected to the vehicle's internal network to interact with other subsystems (e.g., climate control, seat adjustment).
   - The user’s smartphone or other connected devices (if applicable) must be successfully paired with the infotainment system for data synchronization.
   - The system’s software and firmware must be up-to-date and compliant with the latest security and safety standards.

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - The user selects the "User Preferences" menu on the infotainment system.
   - The user interacts with available preferences (e.g., seat adjustment, audio settings, climate controls, etc.).
   - The user confirms the selection of preferences by pressing the "Save" or "Apply" button on the touchscreen interface.
   - The system detects the presence of a stored profile upon login and prompts the user to load existing preferences.
   - The system detects changes in device connections (e.g., when a new smartphone is paired) and prompts the user to sync preferences.

5. **Execution Output**  
   - The system successfully retrieves and displays the current user preferences when the user accesses the "User Preferences" menu.
   - The system applies selected preferences (e.g., adjusts seat position, sets audio volume, loads navigation preferences) immediately upon user confirmation.
   - A confirmation message is displayed to the user after saving preferences, indicating the changes have been successfully stored.
   - The system stores user preferences securely in a database, updating the user profile with the latest configuration.
   - If there is a failure in loading or saving preferences, an error message is displayed with troubleshooting steps or options to retry.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - The system automatically saves any new or modified preferences to the user’s profile when the user exits the preferences menu.
   - If the user chooses to cancel changes, the system reverts to the last saved preferences.
   - The system releases all temporary resources (e.g., session data, configuration states) after the user exits the preferences menu.
   - The system transitions to an idle state after preferences are applied or changes are canceled, ready for the next user interaction.
   - If a system error occurs, appropriate error handling routines are triggered, and the user is prompted to either retry or proceed with default settings.
