**1. Title**  
Personalized In-Car Ambient Lighting Control - Technical Specifications

**2. Functional Description**  
The Personalized In-Car Ambient Lighting Control system enables the user to personalize the interior lighting of the vehicle, adjusting it to their desired preferences. Users can modify the color, brightness, and intensity of the lighting across different zones of the car, including the dashboard, footwells, and door panels. The system can be controlled through the vehicle's central display interface, mobile app, or voice commands. It supports both predefined lighting presets and custom configurations to provide a tailored experience that enhances the ambiance inside the car.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must have a fully functional central control system with an integrated display for controlling lighting settings.
- The ambient lighting hardware (LED strips, panels, etc.) must be installed and properly connected to the vehicle’s electrical system.
- The vehicle must be powered on with all essential control systems (including the lighting module) operational.
- The user must have access to the central control interface, which can be either via a touchscreen, a mobile app, or voice recognition system.
- The system must be fully initialized and ready to respond to input from the user.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The user activates the ambient lighting control system by selecting the lighting control option through the vehicle’s central control interface, mobile app, or voice command.
- The user provides a voice command that includes the words "adjust lighting" or other similar keywords that activate the system.
- The user interacts with the lighting settings via touch or app-based controls, selecting options for color, brightness, or specific lighting zones.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Upon receiving a valid user input, the system processes the request and adjusts the lighting configuration as specified (color, brightness, zone selection).
- The interior lighting updates immediately to reflect the new settings. A visual update of the lighting will be displayed across all zones as per the user’s preferences.
- The system provides a confirmation of the applied changes, either through a visual update on the central display or a message indicating successful changes.
- The updated lighting settings will remain active until the user decides to change them or the vehicle is powered off.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system successfully applies the user’s lighting adjustments, and the new configuration is immediately reflected in the car’s interior.
- If the user exits the lighting control interface or switches to another vehicle function, the lighting settings remain as adjusted until further changes are made.
- In the event of a system error (e.g., malfunction or unresponsiveness), an error message will be displayed, and the system will revert to default settings if the issue is not resolved.
- If the system encounters an issue that prevents it from making the desired changes, it will notify the user and either revert to default lighting or wait for the next valid input to resolve the issue.
