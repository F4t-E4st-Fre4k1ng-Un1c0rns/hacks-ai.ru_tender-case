**2. Functional Description**  
This sub-system allows users to customize the in-car voice assistant's responses to create a personalized interaction. The system provides options to adjust voice tone (e.g., formal, casual), speech speed (e.g., slow, normal, fast), and voice type (e.g., male, female, neutral). The customization settings can be adjusted through the vehicle’s infotainment system or voice commands. Once settings are applied, the voice assistant will consistently use the chosen preferences until modified again by the user. This feature enhances user experience by tailoring the assistant's interactions to match personal preferences.
