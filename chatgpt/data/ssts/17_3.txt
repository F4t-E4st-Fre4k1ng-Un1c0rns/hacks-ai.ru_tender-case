**1. Title**  
Remote Control of Vehicle Features via Mobile App

**2. Functional Description**  
The "Remote Control of Vehicle Features via Mobile App" sub-system enables users to interact with and control specific features of their luxury electric vehicle remotely using a mobile application. This system allows the user to manage functionalities such as locking/unlocking doors, adjusting climate settings, monitoring vehicle status (e.g., battery charge), and controlling lights. Communication between the vehicle and the app is carried out securely via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular data. The system ensures user actions are processed efficiently and provides real-time feedback on the status of the vehicle.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be within range of the mobile app, either through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular network, depending on the feature being accessed.  
- The user must have the mobile app installed and correctly configured, with a valid account linked to the vehicle.  
- The vehicle’s onboard system must be running compatible firmware and allow for remote interactions through secure communication channels.  
- The user must be in an environment with stable internet connectivity (for remote commands via cellular or Wi-Fi).  
- The mobile device must be running the latest version of the app and have an active, stable internet connection to ensure smooth operation of features.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The user launches the mobile app and successfully logs in using valid credentials.  
- The user selects a remote feature from the app interface (e.g., "Lock Doors," "Climate Control").  
- The app attempts to establish a connection to the vehicle, either through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular network.  
- The app detects a system error or connection issue (e.g., "Vehicle Unavailable," "Connection Timeout") and triggers an error message for the user.

**5. Execution Output**  
- When a remote command is successfully executed, the vehicle responds by performing the selected action (e.g., locking doors, adjusting temperature).  
- The mobile app provides immediate, real-time feedback on the status of the vehicle (e.g., confirmation of door lock status, temperature settings).  
- In case of an error (e.g., weak connection), the app notifies the user of the failure and provides suggested troubleshooting steps or prompts the user to retry the action.  
- The vehicle’s status (battery level, door status, etc.) is updated and displayed on the app in real-time.

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**  
- After the successful execution of a feature, the system returns to the main interface of the app, where the user can choose to perform additional actions or exit the app.  
- If an error occurs during feature execution, the app provides clear information about the failure and offers the user options to resolve the issue or retry.  
- In cases of connection issues or system errors, the user is given an option to retry the action or check their network connection before proceeding.  
- Once a command is successfully completed (e.g., doors locked, climate set), the app automatically exits the specific feature menu and returns to the primary user interface, maintaining a seamless user experience.
