### 2. Functional Description  
The Customizable Seat Position and Memory System allows users to save and retrieve personalized seat positions, providing a tailored seating experience. The system supports adjustments for seat depth, height, tilt, and backrest angle. Users can store up to three driver profiles, each containing a unique set of seat settings. The system is activated by pressing the “Memory” button to save or retrieve a profile, which results in the seat automatically adjusting to the saved position. Feedback is provided through visual and/or audible signals to confirm the success of actions such as saving or retrieving a profile.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle must be powered on, or in "Ready" mode, for the system to be operational.
- The seat control interface (buttons or touchscreen) must be accessible and functional.
- The system must have memory capacity available for saving at least three user profiles.
- The seat adjustment mechanism (motorized seat controls) must be functional and free from mechanical faults.
- Initial seat position adjustments must be made by the user before a profile can be saved.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- **User Input**: The system is triggered when the driver presses the "Memory" button to save or retrieve a seat position.
- **Profile Save**: The system is activated when the driver adjusts the seat to their desired position and presses the "Memory" button to store the settings.
- **Profile Retrieval**: The system is triggered when a driver selects a saved profile using the "Memory" button or through the vehicle's control interface.
- **Error Detection**: The system will activate error handling routines if issues occur, such as memory capacity being full or a failure in seat adjustment.

### 5. Execution Output  
- **Profile Save Success**: The seat adjusts to the new position or remains in the current position, and a visual confirmation (e.g., on-screen message or indicator light) confirms the profile has been saved successfully.
- **Profile Retrieval Success**: The seat automatically adjusts to the stored position. A confirmation message is displayed on the vehicle's screen (e.g., "Profile 1 retrieved").
- **Memory Full Error**: If the memory is full, the system displays an error message (e.g., "Memory Full: Overwrite required") and prevents further profiles from being saved unless a profile is deleted or overwritten.
- **Profile Overwrite**: When overwriting a profile, the system asks the user to confirm the action before saving the new settings.

---

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- **Successful Profile Save**: After saving a profile, the seat remains in the saved position, or minor adjustments are made to match the new settings. A confirmation message is shown on the vehicle’s display.
- **Successful Profile Retrieval**: The seat adjusts automatically to the saved position. A confirmation message or signal indicates that the retrieval was successful.
- **Error or Failure**: If the system encounters an error (e.g., motor failure, memory full), it displays an appropriate error message and the seat does not adjust. The user is given the option to resolve the issue (e.g., delete or overwrite profiles).
