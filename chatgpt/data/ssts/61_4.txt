### 2. Functional Description
The Automated Navigation Re-routing Based on Traffic Conditions sub-system is designed to continuously monitor real-time traffic conditions and automatically adjust the vehicle’s route to avoid traffic disruptions, road closures, or accidents. The system will ensure the user’s journey is optimized for time efficiency and safety by recalculating the route based on current traffic data, weather conditions, and road closures. The system is fully integrated with the vehicle's GPS and external traffic data feeds to provide up-to-date re-routing suggestions.

### 3. Enabling Conditions
- The vehicle must be equipped with a fully functional GPS system that is capable of accurately tracking the vehicle’s position.
- The system must have access to reliable real-time traffic data, which requires an active internet connection or cellular data for traffic updates.
- The vehicle’s navigation system must support real-time route adjustments based on traffic information.
- The user must have initiated navigation to a valid destination and granted the necessary permissions for accessing live traffic data.
- The system must be enabled to receive traffic condition updates from external services (e.g., traffic monitoring platforms, government traffic data feeds).

### 4. Trigger Conditions
- Detection of a significant traffic disruption, such as a traffic jam, road closure, or accident, on the current route.
- Identification of an alternative route that is faster or less congested based on real-time traffic data.
- Changes in the road conditions or traffic flow, such as the opening or closing of roads, that would necessitate a route recalculation.
- A request from the user to adjust the route, either manually or by voice command, that triggers the system to reassess the route based on current traffic conditions.

### 5. Execution Output
- The system will automatically calculate and provide an updated route to avoid disruptions and reduce travel time, with real-time guidance displayed on the navigation screen.
- The user will be notified immediately of any detected traffic disruption and be presented with an alternative route if available. The updated route will be displayed along with the estimated time of arrival.
- If the system determines that no viable alternative route exists, it will notify the user of the issue and suggest waiting for traffic conditions to improve, or the user can manually adjust the route if desired.
- In cases where re-routing is not possible, the system will default to the last known route or provide the original route if no disruptions are detected.

---

### 6. Exit Conditions
- The re-routing process will complete successfully when the user is on the new route, and navigation updates are provided accordingly.
- The system will exit to the default navigation mode if no viable re-routing options are available, ensuring that the user is guided along the original or most suitable route based on the available data.
- The system will notify the user of any failure to retrieve real-time traffic data and will either revert to the last available route or request manual input from the user until the connection is restored.
