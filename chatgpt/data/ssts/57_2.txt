**2. Functional Description**  
The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System (EEES) is designed to automatically facilitate the safe evacuation of passengers in a luxury electric vehicle during an emergency. It works by unlocking doors, deploying emergency windows, and providing clear, audible, and visual evacuation signals. The system ensures that passengers can exit the vehicle quickly and safely while also notifying emergency services with relevant data. It supports both automatic and manual triggering mechanisms to ensure functionality in case of system or power failure.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be in an operational state, powered on, and have a functional primary or backup power source.
- The EEES should be integrated with the vehicle’s crash detection, fire detection, and environmental sensors to detect potential hazards.
- All doors and windows must be operational and configured for emergency unlocking or deployment.
- Passengers should be seated with seatbelts fastened, allowing the system to monitor occupancy and movement.
- The system must be regularly calibrated to ensure accurate hazard detection and evacuation process.
- The vehicle must have a network connection that allows communication with emergency services during evacuation.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- Detection of a collision or significant impact through the vehicle’s crash sensors.
- Detection of smoke, heat, or fire inside the vehicle by the fire detection system.
- Manual activation by a passenger or emergency override control in the event of system failure.
- Airbag deployment or other indicators of severe vehicle damage that may hinder normal exit routes.
- The vehicle system enters a compromised state (e.g., power failure) that triggers the manual evacuation override.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system automatically unlocks or deploys the vehicle doors and windows for passenger evacuation.
- Audio-visual alerts (flashing lights and alarm sounds) guide passengers to the nearest safe exit.
- A manual override option is available for passengers to activate evacuation features in case of system malfunction.
- Once activated, the system will notify emergency services with real-time information about the evacuation, including vehicle location and the status of occupants.
- The system ensures that the vehicle remains in an alert state, preventing unauthorized access while passengers are evacuating.

---

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- Once all passengers have exited the vehicle, the system locks the vehicle doors and disables access to prevent unauthorized entry.
- The system logs evacuation data (number of passengers evacuated, time of evacuation, and any system malfunctions).
- If evacuation fails or the system is unable to respond, the vehicle enters an alert state, signaling the issue to the vehicle's control system and notifying emergency services.
- The system resets for future use or enters a diagnostic mode to address any failures detected during the evacuation process.
