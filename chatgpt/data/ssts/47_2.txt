**Technical Specifications: Wi-Fi Hotspot Management and Data Usage Monitoring**

**1. Title**  
Wi-Fi Hotspot Management and Data Usage Monitoring

**2. Functional Description**  
The Wi-Fi Hotspot Management and Data Usage Monitoring sub-system enables users to connect to an in-car Wi-Fi hotspot and manage their data usage. The system supports multiple device connections, tracks data consumption in real-time, allows users to set customized data usage alerts, and provides detailed usage reports. The system also notifies users when they approach or exceed preset data limits. Users can view data summaries, modify settings, and manage connected devices, ensuring an optimal experience for all occupants.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle’s infotainment system must be operational and connected to an active mobile network capable of providing data to the Wi-Fi hotspot.  
- The car's Wi-Fi hotspot feature must be turned on and functional.  
- The user must have a valid data plan with adequate coverage for hotspot usage.  
- The system must support connection for devices using Wi-Fi standards such as 802.11ac.  
- The system must be capable of real-time data usage monitoring, tracking data consumed by connected devices.  
- Users must have access to the car's infotainment system interface or a connected mobile app to interact with the Wi-Fi and data monitoring settings.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- A user initiates a connection to the Wi-Fi hotspot from a compatible device.  
- The system detects a change in data consumption that reaches a predefined threshold (e.g., 80% of total data usage).  
- A user sets or modifies data usage alerts, specifying thresholds for notifications.  
- A user disconnects or reconnects a device to the Wi-Fi hotspot.  
- The system detects an overload or excessive number of connected devices, prompting a warning or adjustment request.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Successful Wi-Fi connection to the hotspot, granting internet access to the user's device.  
- Real-time data usage tracking and display of current consumption on the user interface.  
- Notifications or alerts triggered when data usage reaches the user-defined threshold.  
- Option for the user to adjust data limits and settings (e.g., change threshold, view detailed usage reports).  
- Summary reports or detailed data usage logs that can be reviewed or exported by the user.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- Data usage tracking pauses or resets when the Wi-Fi hotspot is turned off or the user disconnects all devices.  
- The user exits the hotspot management interface, returning to the main infotainment system menu.  
- The system exits after the user successfully modifies data usage limits, with changes reflected in real-time.  
- The system resets data consumption tracking after each session if no devices are connected, ensuring fresh monitoring for the next session.
