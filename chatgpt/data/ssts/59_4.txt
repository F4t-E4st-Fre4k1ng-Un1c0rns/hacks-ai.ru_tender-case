Technical Specifications for Remote Monitoring of EV Battery Health and Charging Status

**2. Functional Description**  
The Remote Monitoring of EV Battery Health and Charging Status sub-system provides users with the capability to remotely monitor their electric vehicle's battery health and charging status. This includes real-time updates on the state of charge, battery temperature, voltage, and cycle count. The system also generates alerts for any abnormalities such as overheating, low charge, or charging malfunctions. Additionally, users can access historical data related to battery performance and charging patterns for optimal vehicle maintenance.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with sensors and a communication interface that supports remote data transmission.
- A stable internet connection (mobile data or Wi-Fi) is required for real-time communication between the vehicle and the user's mobile device or platform.
- The user must have a registered account with the vehicle manufacturer’s monitoring service platform.
- The remote monitoring application or platform should be installed and configured on the user's device (mobile or desktop).
- Battery health monitoring features should be enabled and operational on the vehicle.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is activated when the vehicle is connected to a charging station and the monitoring app or platform is opened by the user.
- If the vehicle's battery health falls outside of predefined thresholds (e.g., overheating or low charge), an alert is triggered.
- User interaction with the monitoring app (e.g., checking battery status or charging progress) triggers the system to fetch and display the relevant data.
- Loss of communication or sensor malfunction triggers a diagnostic message or alert in the system.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system provides real-time data on battery health, including charge percentage, temperature, voltage, and cycle count.
- Users receive immediate alerts for any abnormalities such as overheating, charging interruptions, or malfunctions.
- The system generates a report of historical data for users to review battery performance trends over time, including charging history and health status.
- In the event of a system malfunction or error, the system will generate error messages or diagnostic instructions to guide the user in troubleshooting.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The sub-system exits when the user logs out of the monitoring app, disconnects the vehicle from the charger, or disables the system's connectivity features.
- The system exits automatically after the charging session is complete or when the battery health returns to normal.
- If the system encounters a critical failure (e.g., loss of connection, sensor issues), it may exit the monitoring mode and request the user to perform corrective actions such as reconnecting or contacting support.
