Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations – Technical Specifications (Partially Compliant)

**Functional Description**  
The Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations sub-system provides monitoring of real-time fuel consumption, driving behavior analysis, and personalized recommendations to enhance fuel efficiency. It collects data from vehicle sensors and integrates with a user interface (e.g., mobile app or vehicle dashboard) to present fuel usage metrics and provide actionable insights. The system aims to reduce fuel consumption, improve driving efficiency, and contribute to cost savings, though some features may have limitations due to intermittent connectivity or incomplete data synchronization. Recommendations are based on user driving patterns, but may not always be fully personalized or accurate in all conditions.

**Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with compatible fuel efficiency sensors and an onboard diagnostic system capable of transmitting real-time data.  
- The system must have access to cloud infrastructure for storing and processing user data and delivering recommendations.  
- The user must have registered an active vehicle profile in the system and consented to data collection.  
- Mobile app or vehicle dashboard access must be available to the user for interacting with the system.  
- Stable internet connectivity is required for the system to deliver cloud-based recommendations and updates.  
- The vehicle must support continuous data transmission and integration with the fuel efficiency tracking module.

**Trigger Conditions**  
- The sub-system is triggered when the vehicle is started, activating the fuel efficiency tracking module.  
- A user request to view fuel efficiency information or receive recommendations from the mobile app or dashboard interface.  
- Real-time changes in fuel consumption or driving patterns, such as acceleration, speed, or sudden braking, trigger updates to the recommendations.  
- A significant deviation from optimal fuel consumption behavior (e.g., inefficient driving or unusual fuel usage) triggers a system alert and possible recommendations.  
- Periodic system checks, such as data synchronization or sensor recalibration, trigger updates to the user interface.

**Execution Output**  
- Displays real-time fuel efficiency metrics, including current fuel usage, efficiency levels, and trends over time.  
- Provides personalized recommendations based on driving behavior, including suggestions on speed adjustments, alternative routes, and optimal tire pressure.  
- Generates long-term reports showing overall driving efficiency and fuel consumption trends. Reports may not always include all driving conditions (e.g., city vs. highway driving).  
- Notifications are sent to the user if the system detects inefficiencies or when fuel consumption exceeds preset thresholds, with actionable recommendations provided.  
- Alerts when system synchronization is delayed or connectivity issues affect data accuracy.  
- Basic functionality is available even in offline mode, though recommendations may not be fully personalized.

**Exit Conditions**  
- The system completes a session and provides confirmation that the latest recommendations have been successfully applied.  
- User opts to log out or stop using the system, terminating the active session and halting fuel tracking.  
- The system encounters an error (e.g., sensor malfunction, connectivity loss) and exits the tracking mode, notifying the user of the issue and providing troubleshooting options.  
- The system exits after a reset or manual deactivation of the fuel efficiency tracking module, clearing any temporary data and resetting the system.  
- If connectivity is lost for extended periods, the system provides a summary of data collected before the loss of connection and offers offline recommendations based on the last available data.
