Technical Specifications for Integration of Third-Party Apps into Car Infotainment System

**Functional Description**  
The sub-system for the integration of third-party apps into the car's infotainment system enables users to access and interact with supported third-party applications (e.g., music, navigation, communication) directly from the vehicle's infotainment display. The system supports app interaction via touch controls and voice commands, ensuring ease of use while driving. Key features include real-time data streaming from apps, integration of cloud-based services, and synchronization with the vehicle's built-in systems to maintain safety and convenience.

**Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle’s infotainment system must support third-party app integration through platforms like Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, or proprietary solutions.
- The infotainment system must be running the latest available software version to support new app integrations and security features.
- The user must have a stable internet connection via Wi-Fi, mobile hotspot, or cellular network to enable app integration and data synchronization.
- The user’s mobile device must have the necessary third-party apps installed and configured to connect with the infotainment system.
- User accounts for third-party apps must be properly set up, with necessary subscriptions or permissions granted (e.g., music streaming services, navigation subscriptions).

**Trigger Conditions**  
- The user powers on the car and the infotainment system starts up.
- The infotainment system detects a connected mobile device via Bluetooth, USB, or wireless connection.
- The user selects the “Apps” menu from the infotainment system interface or activates voice command to open the app section.
- The infotainment system detects an available internet connection and establishes synchronization with the third-party apps on the user’s mobile device.

**Execution Output**  
- The infotainment system displays the selected third-party app interface on the screen, allowing users to interact with it (e.g., selecting music tracks, starting navigation, making calls).
- Real-time data from the app is shown, such as song information, navigation route updates, or message alerts.
- Voice commands are processed to control app functionality (e.g., play music, change route, send messages), allowing hands-free operation.
- The system responds with appropriate visual and audio feedback based on user interactions with the app.

**Exit Conditions**  
- The user exits the third-party app interface by selecting a different option in the infotainment system or by returning to the main menu.
- The connection to the mobile device is lost due to a disconnection (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi failure), and the app interface closes or becomes inactive.
- The third-party app fails to respond or crashes, causing the infotainment system to either display an error message or close the app.
- The internet connection is lost, preventing further synchronization with the app, and the user is notified of the issue.
- The user manually disables third-party app integration or disconnects the mobile device, terminating the app session.
