Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System - Technical Specifications

**Functional Description:**  
The Real-Time Collision Avoidance and Warning System is designed to reduce the risk of accidents by detecting potential collision threats in real-time using sensors such as radar, cameras, and LIDAR. The system continuously analyzes the vehicle’s surroundings to identify objects, pedestrians, and other vehicles. If a collision risk is detected, the system alerts the driver through visual, auditory, or haptic signals. In situations of imminent danger, the system can autonomously apply emergency braking or steering to avoid a collision. The system aims to enhance vehicle safety by providing proactive warnings and taking corrective actions when necessary.

**Enabling Conditions:**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary sensors, including radar, cameras, and LIDAR, and the appropriate software for data processing and real-time analysis.  
- The system must be activated by the driver through the vehicle’s user interface, which could be an infotainment screen or physical controls.  
- All sensors must be properly calibrated to ensure accurate and reliable performance.  
- The vehicle's primary software must be fully functional, and the collision avoidance system must be integrated with the vehicle's other safety features, such as braking and steering systems.  
- The system requires a stable power supply from the vehicle’s electrical system to function properly.

**Trigger Conditions:**  
- A potential collision threat is detected by the system, such as an object or pedestrian moving into the vehicle’s path within a specified range.  
- The system’s analysis algorithm detects a risk of collision based on the relative speed, trajectory, and proximity of the detected object.  
- A predefined threshold (e.g., time-to-collision or minimum safe distance) is reached, prompting the system to issue a warning or initiate intervention.  
- The vehicle is on a trajectory that, if unaltered, would lead to a collision with another vehicle, object, or pedestrian.

**Execution Output:**  
- **Warning signals**: If a risk of collision is detected, the system will provide visual alerts (flashing lights on the dashboard or heads-up display), auditory warnings (beeps or voice alerts), and haptic feedback (vibrations in the steering wheel or seat).  
- **Automatic intervention**: If the risk of collision is imminent, the system will autonomously apply emergency braking or steering to mitigate or avoid the collision.  
- **Event logging**: The system logs the event, detailing the detection of the threat, the level of risk, and the corrective actions taken. This data can be reviewed by the driver or service team for diagnostic purposes.  
- **System reset**: After an alert or intervention, the system resets and resumes normal operation, continuously monitoring for new threats.

**Exit Conditions:**  
- The collision threat has been successfully avoided, either through manual driver action (e.g., braking or steering) or automatic intervention by the system.  
- The system resumes its normal monitoring mode once the danger has passed or after an intervention.  
- The vehicle has been maneuvered out of the danger zone, and the system no longer detects a collision risk.  
- The driver manually disables the system or the vehicle reaches a stationary position where the system is no longer required to function.  
- After any automatic intervention, the system verifies that the vehicle is back in a safe driving state and resets to continue monitoring the surrounding environment.
