**Technical Specifications for Multi-User Profile Management for Vehicle Settings**

**1. Title**  
Multi-User Profile Management for Vehicle Settings  

**2. Functional Description**  
The Multi-User Profile Management for Vehicle Settings system enables users to create, manage, and switch between multiple profiles that store personalized vehicle settings such as seat positions, climate control, media preferences, and driving modes. Profiles can be automatically applied based on user identification through methods like key fobs, mobile apps, or biometric recognition. This system allows multiple users to access their preferred vehicle settings seamlessly, enhancing comfort and convenience.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with hardware and software capable of managing multiple user profiles.  
- The vehicle system must support user identification methods such as key fobs, biometric recognition, or mobile app authentication.  
- A central vehicle interface (touchscreen, voice command, or mobile app) must be available to facilitate profile creation, modification, and switching.  
- The vehicle’s settings (seat position, climate control, driving modes, and media preferences) must be adjustable via user profiles.  
- The system must be connected to a cloud or internal storage to save and retrieve profiles and settings.  
- The vehicle must be in an operational state (engine on or in accessory mode) to apply or modify profile settings.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system detects a user identifier via key fob, mobile app, or biometric recognition when the user enters the vehicle.  
- A user manually selects a profile via the central vehicle interface or mobile app.  
- A new user profile is created or an existing profile is modified through the vehicle interface or mobile app.  
- The system encounters a need to automatically switch profiles when a different user enters the vehicle.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The vehicle applies the settings associated with the identified user profile, adjusting parameters such as seat position, climate control, media preferences, and driving modes in real time.  
- If a new user profile is created or an existing profile is modified, the vehicle saves the updated settings in the system, either locally or in the cloud.  
- The vehicle displays the active user profile and the associated settings on the central interface.  
- Any changes made to a profile (e.g., seat position or climate preferences) are immediately applied and stored for future sessions.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The user exits the vehicle, and the system unassigns the active profile, either automatically or upon user request.  
- The system logs out the user after a period of inactivity and resets the profile to default or unassigned settings.  
- The system may revert to default settings or prompt the next user to select or create a new profile if no user is identified.  
- If a technical error occurs, the system will either reset settings to default or prompt the user to resolve the issue, such as re-authenticating or reconnecting.
