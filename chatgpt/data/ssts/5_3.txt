**2. Functional Description**

The Wireless Charging Station Integration for Electric Vehicles (EV) enables seamless, wireless charging of compatible electric vehicles. When an EV is parked over a designated charging area, the system automatically detects the vehicle and begins the charging process. The station utilizes inductive charging technology to transfer power from the charging pad to the vehicle’s battery without physical cables. The system is designed to be intuitive, offering a user-friendly experience with automatic charging initiation and completion notifications via the EV's onboard system or mobile app.

**3. Enabling Conditions**

- The EV must be equipped with compatible wireless charging hardware, supporting inductive charging technology.
- The wireless charging station must be installed with the necessary hardware, including inductive charging coils and sensors, capable of detecting the vehicle.
- The vehicle must be registered within the system for communication and automated charging.
- The wireless charging station must be powered on and connected to the electrical grid.
- The communication protocols for vehicle detection, authentication, and charging (e.g., RFID, Bluetooth) must be functional.

**4. Trigger Conditions**

- The system will detect the presence of a compatible EV within a defined proximity range to the charging station.
- The charging station will trigger when the vehicle is properly aligned with the charging pad, ensuring inductive charging is possible.
- The vehicle will send a signal to the station indicating readiness for charging once alignment is confirmed.
- If alignment is incorrect, the charging process will be temporarily halted, and the system will notify the user to adjust the vehicle's position for proper charging.

**5. Execution Output**

- Upon successful detection and alignment, the charging station will begin transmitting energy to the vehicle’s battery.
- The vehicle will display charging status and estimated time remaining on the onboard dashboard or through the mobile app.
- Energy consumption, charging duration, and transaction details will be recorded and accessible via the user’s account.
- If charging is successful, the system will stop transmitting energy once the battery is fully charged, and the vehicle will notify the user that charging is complete.

**6. Exit Conditions**

- The charging process will end when the vehicle reaches the desired state of charge, or the user manually ends the session via the mobile app or onboard system.
- If any failure or issue occurs (e.g., misalignment or communication failure), the system will notify the user to correct the issue or seek alternative charging options.
- Once charging completes or stops, the system will provide a notification confirming the charging status and the amount of energy used, and the session will be logged for future reference.
