### 2. Functional Description  
The *Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations* sub-system is designed to enhance driving safety and comfort by providing real-time alerts about road conditions and offering adaptive driving recommendations based on these conditions. The system continuously monitors the road through various sensors and external data, such as weather and traffic conditions, to detect hazards like wet surfaces, icy patches, or construction zones. It then suggests appropriate driving modes (e.g., slippery road mode) and speed adjustments to optimize safety and vehicle performance.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle must be equipped with road sensors capable of detecting environmental conditions such as wetness, ice, or surface irregularities.
- The vehicle should have an active and stable internet connection for receiving real-time road condition updates from cloud services.
- The system requires an interface (visual display and auditory signals) for alerting the driver to detected hazards.
- The vehicle must support adaptive driving modes (e.g., eco, sport, slippery mode) to implement the driving recommendations.
- The system requires power from the vehicle’s electrical system to operate sensors, displays, and connectivity modules.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The system is triggered automatically when the vehicle starts and begins to move, assuming the enabling conditions are met.
- Road condition monitoring is continuously active during vehicle operation, and alerts are triggered when hazardous conditions are detected (e.g., wet roads, ice).
- Adaptive recommendations are triggered when the system detects a hazardous road condition requiring a change in driving style, such as a slower speed or switching to a specific driving mode (e.g., slippery road mode).
- If the vehicle’s connectivity to cloud services is lost, the system defaults to using local data until connectivity is restored.

### 5. Execution Output  
- When a hazardous road condition is detected, the system generates real-time visual and auditory alerts, informing the driver of the specific hazard (e.g., “icy road ahead”).
- The system provides adaptive driving recommendations, such as suggesting a reduction in speed or switching to a different driving mode (e.g., slippery mode).
- The system continually monitors the road and updates alerts and recommendations in real-time based on new data or changes in road conditions.
- If the system detects a loss of connectivity, it will notify the driver and continue functioning with limited capabilities based on local data.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The system exits or reverts to standard driving mode once the hazardous road condition has cleared or improved (e.g., road dries, ice melts).
- When cloud connectivity is restored, the system will resume receiving real-time updates and adaptive recommendations.
- The system deactivates when the vehicle is turned off or when the driving session ends, with all data being reset for the next session.
