**Technical Specifications: User Preferences Management for Infotainment System**

1. **Title**
   - User Preferences Management for Infotainment System

2. **Functional Description**
   The User Preferences Management sub-System enables users to personalize their infotainment experience by storing and managing preferences such as audio settings, navigation preferences, and display configurations. The system ensures that these preferences are automatically loaded upon vehicle entry and are persistent across sessions. In the event of errors or missing profiles, the system prompts the user to resolve the issue through simple actions such as logging in or creating a new profile. The system is designed to provide a seamless, consistent, and tailored user experience, fully aligned with user expectations.

3. **Enabling Conditions**
   - The infotainment system is powered on and fully operational.
   - The user profile exists and is linked to the vehicle’s infotainment system.
   - The system is connected to the vehicle’s internal network and can access user profile data.
   - The user is authenticated, either through a manual login or an automated profile detection system.
   - The vehicle’s infotainment system supports data persistence for storing user preferences.

4. **Trigger Conditions**
   - The user enters the vehicle, and the infotainment system powers on automatically.
   - The system detects the presence of an active user profile.
   - The user manually adjusts any settings related to audio, display, or navigation preferences.
   - The system encounters a failure to detect the user profile and prompts for login or profile creation.
   - A system restart occurs or the user changes the vehicle, triggering the need to load saved preferences.

5. **Execution Output**
   - Upon successful profile detection, the system automatically loads the user’s saved preferences (audio settings, display configurations, navigation preferences, etc.).
   - If no profile is detected, the system prompts the user to log in or create a new profile.
   - Preferences adjusted by the user are immediately saved to the system and will be applied in future sessions.
   - In the case of an error, the system will clearly notify the user and guide them through resolving the issue, such as re-entering preferences or creating a new profile.
   - The system will persist user preferences even after power cycles or vehicle restarts.

6. **Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**
   - The user’s preferences are successfully updated and saved to their profile.
   - The system successfully loads the stored preferences for the next session, ensuring a personalized experience.
   - If an error occurs, the system prompts the user with actionable steps (e.g., log in, create a profile) to resolve the issue, maintaining the system’s usability.
   - The system completes the session without failure, with user preferences fully reflected and available for future interactions.
