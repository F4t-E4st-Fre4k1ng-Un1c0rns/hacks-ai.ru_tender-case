**Technical Specifications: Customizable Seat Position and Memory System**

### 1. Title  
Customizable Seat Position and Memory System

### 2. Functional Description  
The Customizable Seat Position and Memory System allows users to adjust the seat position in multiple directions, including forward/backward, up/down, and tilt. The system enables the user to save these adjustments to their personal profile, allowing the seat to automatically return to the saved position whenever the user enters the vehicle. This functionality ensures that the driver or passenger enjoys a consistent and personalized seating experience. The system also supports the creation and storage of multiple user profiles, ensuring that each user can recall their settings independently.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle must be powered on and the system fully operational.
- The seat must have electrical actuators capable of precise seat adjustments (forward/backward, height, tilt).
- The user must have a saved profile or be allowed to create a new profile with custom seat settings.
- Sufficient battery power must be available to support the system’s operation.
- The vehicle’s control system must be integrated with the seat adjustment system to ensure seamless operation.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The system is activated when the user logs into their profile via the vehicle’s interface or manually initiates the seat adjustment function.
- Triggered by physical interaction with seat controls (buttons or touch interface) or when the vehicle detects the user profile upon entry.
- If no user profile is saved, the system will prompt the user to save the current seat position after adjustment.

### 5. Execution Output  
- Upon receiving a command, the system adjusts the seat position to the specified settings (forward/backward, up/down, tilt).
- After seat adjustment, the system offers the option to save the current seat position to the user’s profile.
- If a user profile is selected or detected, the system automatically recalls the saved seat position and adjusts the seat accordingly.
- The system provides confirmation feedback (e.g., “Seat Position Saved” or “Seat Adjusted”) through the vehicle’s interface.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The system exits the seat adjustment process once the seat reaches the requested position and the operation is complete.
- If a seat memory is successfully saved, the system exits with confirmation, and the seat remains in the newly adjusted position.
- If the system encounters a malfunction (e.g., power failure, actuator issue), it terminates the process and displays an error message or alert (e.g., "Seat Adjustment Failed").
- Upon successful seat recall, the system exits the adjustment mode and leaves the seat in the recalled position.
