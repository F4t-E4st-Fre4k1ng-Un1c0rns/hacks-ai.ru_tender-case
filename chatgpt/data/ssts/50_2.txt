**Technical Specifications: Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface**

**1. Title**  
Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface

**2. Functional Description**  
The Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface allows users to automatically pay for parking through their vehicle’s integrated interface. The system detects the vehicle's parking session, calculates the applicable parking fee, and processes payment through a linked user account. The user receives confirmation of successful payment, allowing them to depart without further action. The system uses RFID communication technology to interact with compatible parking meters or management systems. This specification is **largely compliant**, with some limitations in seamless integration and user interaction.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The parking facility must be equipped with RFID-compatible parking meters or systems that support automatic payment processing via vehicle interface.
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary hardware (e.g., RFID reader) and software (e.g., communication protocol) to interface with the parking system.
- The user must have an active account linked to the vehicle, with a valid and sufficient payment method (credit card, digital wallet, etc.).
- The vehicle must be connected to a reliable data network (e.g., cellular or Wi-Fi) for payment authorization and transaction processing.
- The system must be compatible with the specific parking service provider’s payment gateway.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The vehicle enters a parking zone equipped with compatible RFID-based payment infrastructure.
- The system detects the vehicle’s presence via RFID signals and begins the parking session.
- The user confirms the payment authorization through the vehicle’s interface (manual intervention required in certain scenarios).
- The system identifies the parking spot’s payment rate, duration, and total fee based on real-time data from the parking infrastructure.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system calculates the parking fee based on the time the vehicle has been parked and the applicable rates for the location.
- Payment is processed through the linked user account, using the payment method stored in the vehicle’s profile.
- Upon successful payment, the vehicle interface displays a confirmation message to the user, indicating the payment was successful.
- A digital receipt is generated and sent to the user’s registered email or app.
- The parking system updates to reflect the payment, allowing the vehicle to exit without additional validation in most cases.

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**  
- After successful payment, the parking system allows the vehicle to depart without the need for manual payment at a kiosk or additional validation.
- If the system experiences connectivity issues or a failure in payment authorization, the user is notified via the vehicle interface and prompted to pay manually at a kiosk or via mobile app.
- The parking session is marked as paid and active in the parking system, with a grace period allowed for users to leave without further charge.
- If the user’s payment method is invalid or insufficient, the system notifies the user of the issue and provides options for updating payment information.
