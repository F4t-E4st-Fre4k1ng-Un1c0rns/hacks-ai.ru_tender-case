**Technical Specifications for Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations**

1. **Title**  
   Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations

2. **Functional Description**  
   The Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations sub-system is designed to collect and analyze energy consumption data from the vehicle’s energy management system (EMS). It provides users with real-time feedback on energy efficiency, tracks driving behavior (e.g., speed, acceleration, braking), and offers personalized suggestions for improving fuel economy. The system generates periodic efficiency reports, compares current usage against historical data, and delivers recommendations for energy optimization. This system helps users reduce their carbon footprint, lower operating costs, and enhance the driving experience through data-driven insights.

3. **Enabling Conditions**  
   - The vehicle must be equipped with a functional energy management system (EMS) and the necessary sensors to monitor energy consumption and driving parameters.
   - The user must have a registered account within the vehicle’s mobile application or onboard interface to access the Fuel Efficiency Tracking and Recommendations system.
   - The system requires an active internet connection for data synchronization and cloud-based analysis.
   - The vehicle must undergo an initial calibration to ensure that all sensors and tracking functionalities are set up correctly for optimal performance.
   - User consent must be obtained to track and store driving data, as per applicable privacy regulations.

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - The system is triggered when the vehicle’s ignition is turned on, and the EMS begins collecting data on energy usage.
   - The system activates when the vehicle enters driving mode, beginning the tracking of energy consumption, speed, and driving behavior.
   - If the user requests an efficiency report via the mobile app or the vehicle’s onboard display, the system triggers data processing to generate the report.
   - Triggering also occurs automatically when specific driving behavior (e.g., rapid acceleration or frequent braking) is detected, prompting real-time feedback or recommendations.

5. **Execution Output**  
   - Real-time display of current energy efficiency metrics, such as miles per kilowatt-hour, fuel economy trends, and instantaneous consumption data.
   - System-generated recommendations for improving driving efficiency, such as reducing acceleration, driving at steady speeds, or utilizing eco-driving modes.
   - A summary report after each trip, including detailed analysis of energy consumption, comparison with historical data, and actionable recommendations for future driving.
   - Alerts or notifications when inefficient driving patterns are detected, offering immediate corrective feedback.
   - Periodic efficiency reports (e.g., weekly, monthly) summarizing overall energy usage trends and comparing them to optimal efficiency targets.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - The system exits tracking mode once the vehicle is turned off, finalizing the energy consumption data and preparing it for synchronization with the cloud.
   - If the system encounters an error or malfunction (e.g., sensor failure, connectivity issue), it enters a fail-safe mode, alerting the user that full functionality may be unavailable until the issue is resolved.
   - Upon completing a trip, the system generates the final energy efficiency report and stores the data for future analysis, ensuring that all session data is uploaded successfully.
   - In case of a service interruption (e.g., loss of internet connection), the system will temporarily hold the generated reports and synchronize them once the connection is restored.
