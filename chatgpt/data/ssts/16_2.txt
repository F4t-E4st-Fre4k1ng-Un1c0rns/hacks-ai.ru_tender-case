**2. Functional Description**

The Voice-Activated Climate Control System allows users to control their vehicle’s climate settings using voice commands. It is designed to provide a hands-free experience for adjusting temperature, air conditioning, seat heating, and ventilation. The system aims to enhance user convenience and comfort while driving by enabling intuitive voice control of various climate features.

**3. Enabling Conditions**

- The system is installed and integrated with the vehicle’s onboard climate control and voice recognition system.
- The voice control system must be activated by a user command or a manual button to engage the voice recognition feature.
- The vehicle’s internal sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality, etc.) and climate control system must be functioning.
- The microphone array must be within range of the user’s voice, and the environment should have minimal background noise for accurate voice detection.

**4. Trigger Conditions**

- A valid voice command must be recognized by the system, corresponding to one of the predefined climate control actions (e.g., adjust temperature, modify air conditioning settings, activate seat heaters).
- The system will trigger a response upon receiving a clear and valid voice input.
- The system will enter a listening state upon activation, awaiting the next user command.

**5. Execution Output**

- The system adjusts the vehicle’s internal temperature, air conditioning, seat heating, or ventilation according to the voice command.
- The system will output confirmation via the vehicle’s display, confirming the action has been performed (e.g., “Temperature set to 22°C” or “Air conditioning increased”).
- The system should process the voice command within 2-3 seconds of receiving input and execute the corresponding action promptly.

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Criteria**

- The system successfully executes the requested climate adjustment and exits the active listening mode.
- If no valid command is received within a predefined time (e.g., 30 seconds), the system will return to an idle state, awaiting further input.
- In case of an error (e.g., invalid command, system malfunction), the system will notify the user via the vehicle’s display and exit to a manual control mode.
- The system will return to idle after completing the command or when it detects a lack of further user input for a specified duration (e.g., 5 minutes).
