**1. Title**  
Partially Compliant Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance)

**2. Functional Description**  
The Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance) is designed to support the driver in automating the parking process. This system assists in detecting parking spaces, steering the vehicle into the space, and controlling acceleration and braking. It operates using various sensors, including cameras and proximity detectors, to monitor the surroundings and execute precise parking maneuvers. While the system performs well in most conditions, certain edge cases and environmental factors can limit its functionality, resulting in partial compliance with the full set of intended features. This may include reduced sensor performance under poor weather conditions or challenges with tight parking spaces.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle is equipped with all necessary sensors (cameras, proximity sensors, ultrasonic sensors) that are in good working condition.
- The Driver-Assisted Parking System must be activated through the vehicle’s infotainment system or a dedicated button.
- The parking area is large enough to accommodate the vehicle without obstacles such as curbs, large debris, or other vehicles blocking the space.
- The vehicle’s battery and power systems are functioning correctly to support sensor operation and control of steering, brakes, and acceleration.
- The system must be calibrated and configured correctly within the vehicle's software to ensure compatibility with the specific vehicle model and sensor configuration.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system detects an available parking space via its sensors as the vehicle approaches.
- The driver initiates the parking process by selecting a suitable parking space on the infotainment display or via voice command.
- The system identifies that the vehicle is within a certain proximity (typically 1-3 meters) of the parking space and the parking space is adequately sized for the vehicle.
- The system is activated through the user's manual confirmation, either through a touch screen interface or a voice command, to engage the automated parking process.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system takes full control of the vehicle’s steering, throttle, and braking once parking is initiated.
- The vehicle is steered into the parking space while maintaining safe distances from surrounding obstacles, with speed and acceleration controlled to ensure smooth entry into the space.
- Visual and auditory feedback is provided to the driver through the infotainment display and in-vehicle speakers, indicating the success of the parking maneuver or providing a warning if an issue arises.
- Upon successful parking, the system locks the steering and disengages, leaving the vehicle safely parked within the defined space. A confirmation alert is displayed to the driver to indicate the completion of the process.
- In case of a failure (e.g., sensor malfunction or obstacle detection), the system will display an error message and suggest manual intervention.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system successfully completes the parking process, with the vehicle fully aligned within the boundaries of the parking space and the steering disengaged.
- If the system detects any failure or obstacle that prevents safe parking, it will halt the process and notify the driver with an error message, prompting them to resume manual control.
- The parking assist feature will automatically disengage when the parking maneuver is finished or when the system detects that further action is needed from the driver, either to correct the position or to resume manual parking.
- In the case of partial compliance, such as sensor degradation in poor weather conditions, the system may require the driver to manually intervene and complete the parking process.
