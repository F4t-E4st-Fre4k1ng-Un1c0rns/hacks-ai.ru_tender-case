**Title:** Emergency Roadside Assistance Integration - Technical Specifications

**Functional Description:**  
The Emergency Roadside Assistance Integration allows the user to request assistance in case of a vehicle breakdown or emergency. The system enables the user to manually initiate contact with a roadside assistance provider by pressing a dedicated button or using a voice command. The system transmits the vehicle's current location, vehicle status, and emergency details to the provider. Once connected, the system provides the user with status updates and estimated time of arrival for assistance. However, the system does not include full automation for detecting specific vehicle malfunctions (e.g., tire pressure drop or engine failure) and relies on user action to start the request process.

**Enabling Conditions:**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary hardware and software to support the Emergency Roadside Assistance Integration.
- The vehicle must have an active data connection (cellular or Wi-Fi) capable of transmitting the user’s location and emergency details.
- The user must have an active account with a compatible roadside assistance provider.
- The system should be running the latest software version that includes updates for the Emergency Roadside Assistance feature.

**Trigger Conditions:**  
- The user activates the roadside assistance feature manually, either by pressing the "Roadside Assistance" button on the vehicle interface or by issuing a voice command to the vehicle.
- The system detects that the user requires roadside assistance, based on user input or action.

**Execution Output:**  
- Upon activation, the system attempts to establish a connection with the roadside assistance provider, transmitting the user’s location and emergency details.
- Once the connection is established, the user receives a confirmation message, including an estimated time of arrival for the assistance team.
- The system provides periodic status updates regarding the arrival of the assistance team and other relevant information.
- If there is no connection available, the system will notify the user of the failure and prompt for manual intervention (e.g., phone call or waiting for network recovery).

**Exit Conditions:**  
- The roadside assistance team arrives at the specified location and successfully resolves the issue (e.g., tire change, battery jump-start, etc.).
- The user manually cancels the roadside assistance request via the vehicle interface or another communication channel.
- The system fails to establish a connection due to network issues, and the user is prompted with alternative actions such as calling for help or waiting for network recovery.
