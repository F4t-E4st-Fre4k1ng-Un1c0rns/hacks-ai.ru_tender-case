**1. Title**  
In-Car Payment System Integration for Toll and Parking

**2. Functional Description**  
The In-Car Payment System Integration for Toll and Parking enables seamless, automated payment transactions for toll roads and parking facilities directly through the vehicle's infotainment system. The system interfaces with toll operators and parking infrastructures to process payments upon proximity detection. It verifies user payment methods, communicates with external payment systems, and provides real-time feedback on the transaction status. In the event of failure or issues, the system will prompt the driver to proceed with alternative payment methods. The system’s primary function is to reduce manual payment processes, providing luxury vehicle owners with a fully integrated, efficient payment experience.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle is equipped with an infotainment system capable of processing external payment transactions and has the necessary communication modules (e.g., GPS, cellular connectivity).
- The user has registered and linked a valid payment method (e.g., credit card, digital wallet) within the system settings.
- The system is configured to communicate with toll operators, parking facilities, and external payment service providers through an internet connection.
- GPS functionality and network connectivity are operational in the vehicle to ensure the system can detect and interact with toll booths or parking facilities.
- The user has accepted and acknowledged all applicable terms, conditions, and privacy policies as part of the system setup process.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The vehicle approaches a supported toll booth or parking facility, which the system recognizes via GPS.
- The system identifies the location of the toll booth or parking station and triggers the payment process automatically.
- The system confirms that the user’s account is active and linked to a valid payment method with sufficient balance or credit.
- Communication with the toll operator or parking system is established, confirming readiness for payment processing.
  
**5. Execution Output**  
- Upon successful payment processing, the system provides visual confirmation to the driver through the infotainment screen, including the payment amount and transaction details.
- The vehicle’s system will trigger any relevant actions, such as opening the toll booth barrier or allowing access to the parking facility.
- A transaction record is generated and stored within the vehicle’s system for future reference or billing.
- If payment is successfully processed, the user will be notified of the completion and closure of the transaction.
  
**6. Exit Conditions**  
- Once the payment is successfully processed, the system exits the transaction flow and returns the driver to the normal vehicle interface.
- If a payment fails due to technical issues (e.g., connectivity failure), the system exits the transaction process, logs the error, and notifies the driver of the issue.
- In the event of an unresolved failure (e.g., network downtime or incompatible toll system), the driver is prompted to use an alternative payment method, such as manual payment or a mobile app.
- If a user bypasses the automatic payment system (e.g., via manual override), the system will exit the automated transaction flow and allow the user to proceed manually.
