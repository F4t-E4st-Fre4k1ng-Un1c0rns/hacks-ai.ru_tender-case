Technical Specifications for Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control Sub-System

**Functional Description**  
The Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control sub-system is designed to securely identify and grant access to authorized drivers of luxury electric vehicles. The system uses biometric recognition (e.g., facial recognition, fingerprint scanning) or credential-based identification (e.g., RFID cards) to verify the driver’s identity. Upon successful verification, the system grants access to the vehicle, adjusts personalized settings such as seat position and mirror alignment, and enables the vehicle's operational features. If authentication fails, access is denied and a log of the event is generated for security purposes.

**Enabling Conditions**  
- The driver must have pre-registered their biometric data or credential (e.g., RFID card or vehicle-specific key) in the vehicle’s identification system.
- The vehicle must be equipped with necessary hardware such as facial recognition cameras, fingerprint scanners, and/or RFID sensors.
- The vehicle’s system must be powered on and in a state ready for authentication (not in "sleep" or "locked" mode).
- Communication between the vehicle’s system and identification hardware must be stable and functional.
- The system must have the capability to store and retrieve personalized driver settings, including seat positions, mirror adjustments, and infotainment preferences.

**Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is triggered when an individual approaches the vehicle, and the identification hardware detects the presence of an authorized driver.
- The system begins the authentication process automatically as soon as proximity is detected or when the driver attempts to engage the vehicle (e.g., by touching a sensor or activating a vehicle control).
- The system continuously monitors the proximity of the driver and triggers the identification process when a potential driver is within range.

**Execution Output**  
- Upon successful authentication, the system will unlock the vehicle and apply the driver’s personalized settings, such as seat position, mirror adjustments, and infotainment preferences, based on the pre-registered profile.
- If authentication is unsuccessful, the system will deny access to the vehicle and display an error message. The system will log the failed authentication attempt, including the timestamp and reason for failure (e.g., unrecognized credentials).
- If the identification hardware detects an error or malfunction during the process, the system will alert the driver and log the error for further diagnostics.

**Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**  
- The system exits the authentication process successfully upon verification, granting access to the vehicle and allowing the driver to start the vehicle.
- If authentication fails, the system exits the process by leaving the vehicle locked and denying access. A detailed log of the failed attempt is generated.
- Once the vehicle is started and in motion, the system exits the authentication process, and the driver can operate the vehicle without further interaction with the identification system.
- In the event of a hardware malfunction or failure to authenticate, the system will provide an error notification and log the incident. If the problem persists, the system may prompt the user to contact technical support.
