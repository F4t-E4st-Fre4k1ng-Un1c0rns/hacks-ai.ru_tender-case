### 1. Title  
**Automatic Bluetooth Pairing for Multiple Devices**

### 2. Functional Description  
The **Automatic Bluetooth Pairing for Multiple Devices** sub-system provides the capability to automatically detect and pair multiple Bluetooth devices with the vehicle’s infotainment system without requiring manual intervention from the user. The system will maintain a connection to all paired devices and seamlessly switch between them as needed, ensuring uninterrupted access to connected features such as hands-free calling, media streaming, and other Bluetooth-enabled services. Devices that have been previously paired will be prioritized for automatic reconnection when they come within range of the vehicle’s system.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle’s infotainment system must be powered on and fully functional with Bluetooth support enabled.
- Bluetooth must be enabled on the user’s devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.) and the devices must be within the operational range of the vehicle.
- The system must support the simultaneous connection and management of multiple Bluetooth devices.
- Devices must have been paired with the vehicle system in the past or set up for initial pairing.
- User permissions must allow the vehicle system to automatically pair with Bluetooth devices without requiring additional confirmation or manual input after initial setup.
- The vehicle must be in a state that supports Bluetooth scanning (either in idle or active mode).

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The vehicle’s Bluetooth system automatically enters pairing mode when the vehicle is powered on.
- A Bluetooth-enabled device (previously paired or in pairing mode) comes into range of the vehicle’s Bluetooth system.
- Bluetooth is enabled on the user’s device and it is configured to automatically reconnect with the vehicle system.

### 5. Execution Output  
- Once a device is detected, the vehicle’s infotainment system will **automatically pair with the device**, establishing a secure Bluetooth connection without user input.
- The system will display a notification on the infotainment screen confirming the successful pairing, indicating the name of the device connected (e.g., “Device XYZ connected”).
- If multiple devices are detected, the system will automatically prioritize and pair with the previously connected devices first, managing up to **three simultaneous Bluetooth connections** (e.g., smartphone, tablet, and music device).
- If no previously paired devices are found, the system will prompt the user to either enable Bluetooth on the device or manually initiate the pairing process.
- The system will **maintain an active connection** for all paired devices, and users can seamlessly switch between them (e.g., switching from phone to music device without disconnecting or re-pairing).

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The system will enter a **standby mode** once all pairing tasks are complete, and the user can begin using the connected devices as needed.
- If the system encounters an error during pairing or connection, it will **notify the user of the failure** (e.g., "Pairing unsuccessful. Please check your device settings.") and allow the user to retry or cancel.
- When a device is successfully paired, the system will **retain the connection throughout the vehicle’s operation**, reconnecting automatically each time the user enters the vehicle.
- If a device is disconnected or goes out of range, the system will attempt to **reconnect automatically** once the device is back within range or within Bluetooth pairing mode.
