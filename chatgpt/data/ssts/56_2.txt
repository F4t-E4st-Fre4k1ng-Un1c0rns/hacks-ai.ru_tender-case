---

### Functional Description  
The **In-Vehicle Cloud Storage for Personal Data and Music** sub-system enables users to seamlessly manage and access their personal data, music, and other media files via cloud storage, integrated directly into the vehicle’s infotainment system. This sub-system supports the upload, download, organization, and streaming of media content, while also enabling synchronization between the vehicle’s system and other connected personal devices. Users can access their personal music libraries, contacts, and other media files directly from the cloud and interact with them via the vehicle's interface.

### Enabling Conditions  
1. The vehicle must have reliable internet connectivity (via Wi-Fi or cellular data) for access to the cloud storage.  
2. The vehicle’s infotainment system must support the latest software version compatible with the cloud storage integration.  
3. The user must have a registered cloud storage account linked to the vehicle’s infotainment system.  
4. The user’s mobile device must be paired with the vehicle via Bluetooth or an equivalent connection method for synchronization and data transfer.  
5. The user must grant the vehicle appropriate permissions to access and store personal data, including music, contacts, photos, and other media, in the cloud.

### Trigger Conditions  
1. The system is powered on, and the user logs into the infotainment system using their cloud account credentials.  
2. The user selects the 'Music' or 'Personal Data' menu option in the vehicle's infotainment system.  
3. The user requests to upload, download, or stream a file from the cloud storage, either via the touchscreen interface or voice command.  
4. The user requests to synchronize personal data between the vehicle and another device (such as a smartphone or tablet).  
5. A connection error or failure triggers a notification informing the user that the cloud service is unavailable, and prompts to reconnect when possible.

### Execution Output  
1. The system will stream or display the selected media (music, photos, documents, etc.) from the cloud storage directly to the vehicle’s infotainment system.  
2. Files uploaded from the vehicle are successfully added to the cloud storage and confirmed by the system.  
3. The system will remove any files that have been deleted by the user from the cloud storage, ensuring synchronization across all connected devices.  
4. The system will organize uploaded content, such as music playlists and personal data, ensuring proper categorization and access on both the cloud storage and vehicle interface.  
5. Successful synchronization between the vehicle and external devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) occurs, ensuring that new or updated data is reflected across all platforms.

### Exit Conditions  
1. The user logs out from the infotainment system, securely disconnecting from the cloud storage and clearing all sensitive data from the vehicle’s interface.  
2. After successful logout, the vehicle’s system will return to its home screen and await the next user interaction.  
3. In the event of a session failure (e.g., loss of internet connection or account error), the system will notify the user of the issue and provide instructions for reconnection or resolution.  
4. If the system is unable to access cloud data (e.g., due to no internet connection), the vehicle will enter offline mode, allowing access to locally stored data until connectivity is restored.  
5. Any media or data accessed, modified, or uploaded during the session will be securely saved or discarded based on the user's actions, with the final result synchronized across linked devices.
