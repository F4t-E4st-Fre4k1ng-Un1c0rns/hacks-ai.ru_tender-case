**1. Title**  
Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations

**2. Functional Description**  
The Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations system provides real-time alerts to the driver regarding hazardous road conditions (e.g., slippery roads, obstacles, weather-related issues) and automatically adjusts vehicle behavior, such as speed, to enhance driving safety. Additionally, it offers adaptive recommendations for driving maneuvers based on detected conditions (e.g., recommended speed reductions, lane changes, or other safety-related actions). The system utilizes vehicle sensors, external data feeds (e.g., weather and traffic updates), and GPS to monitor and respond to dynamic road conditions. The primary goal is to improve driver safety, efficiency, and comfort by proactively responding to road conditions.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle is equipped with the necessary sensors (e.g., radar, LIDAR, cameras) to detect road conditions, hazards, and the environment.
- The system has access to a real-time external data feed, providing weather updates, traffic conditions, and other relevant information for hazard detection.
- The vehicle software is running the latest version of the Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations feature.
- The driver has enabled the feature through the vehicle’s settings interface.
- The vehicle is calibrated for its specific parameters, including speed capabilities, handling characteristics, and preferred driving modes (e.g., Eco, Comfort, Sport).
- The vehicle is within an operational range where communication with external data sources (e.g., satellite, cellular network) is reliable.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system detects a significant change in road conditions (e.g., rain, snow, fog, ice, potholes, or debris) through the vehicle’s sensors.
- The system receives updates from external data sources (e.g., live traffic or weather feeds indicating potential hazards).
- The vehicle exceeds certain speed thresholds, which may trigger recommendations for adaptive speed adjustments.
- The vehicle enters high-risk areas (e.g., construction zones, school zones, accident-prone areas).
- A hazard (e.g., accident, object, or vehicle ahead) is detected within the vehicle's sensor range or through external data sources.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system alerts the driver with a clear notification about the detected road condition or hazard (e.g., "Wet road conditions ahead, reduce speed by 10 mph").
- Adaptive recommendations are displayed on the dashboard, including suggested speed changes, lane alterations, or other driving behaviors to enhance safety.
- The vehicle automatically adjusts its speed in response to the recommendation if the driver does not manually override the suggestion.
- Continuous updates are provided to the driver regarding any changes in road conditions or additional hazards detected.
- If necessary, the system provides instructions for the driver to manually execute recommended actions (e.g., steering or lane change) until the system is able to take further autonomous actions.
- In case of data loss or system malfunction, the system alerts the driver and suggests a manual safety mode with predefined settings, such as reduced speed.

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**  
- The system exits adaptive mode when road conditions improve or when the hazard is cleared, with notifications indicating the resolution of the issue.
- The system ceases to provide alerts when road conditions no longer require action, and the vehicle returns to normal driving behavior.
- If external data becomes unavailable, the system will alert the driver and suggest switching to a default safety mode, such as reduced speed or cautious driving, until the connection is restored.
- When the system detects that it is no longer operational (e.g., sensor failure or communication breakdown), it will notify the driver and recommend manual driving adjustments.
- The system will automatically exit its adaptive driving mode if the driver manually disables the feature or overrides a recommendation, reverting to standard driving operation.
