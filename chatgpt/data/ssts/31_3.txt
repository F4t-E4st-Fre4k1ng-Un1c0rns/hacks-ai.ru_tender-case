1. **Title**  
   Voice-Controlled Vehicle Settings Customization

2. **Functional Description**  
   The Voice-Controlled Vehicle Settings Customization sub-system allows users to modify vehicle settings through voice commands. The system facilitates control over various in-vehicle features such as seat position, cabin temperature, lighting, and infotainment preferences. While designed to provide hands-free convenience, the system is partially compliant, meaning that some commands may not be fully recognized or may require additional steps. The user interacts with the system by issuing voice commands, which the system processes to adjust vehicle settings. Feedback can be provided verbally, visually, or through a combination of both, depending on the feature being controlled.

3. **Enabling Conditions**  
   - The voice recognition system must be installed and operational within the vehicle.  
   - The vehicle must be equipped with internal systems that can be controlled via voice commands (seat, HVAC, lighting, infotainment).  
   - The voice control system must be activated and connected to the vehicle's network, with all supported features enabled for use.  
   - The user must have a valid profile associated with the vehicle to ensure authorized control of the settings.  
   - The vehicle must be stationary or traveling at low speed to ensure safe interaction with the voice system.

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - A verbal command is issued clearly by the user (e.g., "Hey [Car Name], adjust the seat position").  
   - The vehicle’s voice recognition system is in an active listening state, awaiting commands.  
   - The command falls within the predefined set of recognized commands (e.g., "adjust seat," "set temperature").  
   - The vehicle is within an environment where the system can process commands (i.e., limited background noise or within a safe driving context).

5. **Execution Output**  
   - The system will recognize the voice command and process it by sending appropriate signals to the relevant subsystems (e.g., seat adjustment, climate control).  
   - The user will receive a confirmation of the action, either through a verbal response (e.g., "The seat has been adjusted") or a visual confirmation on the vehicle’s dashboard or infotainment display.  
   - If the command is partially understood or misinterpreted, the system will return a request for clarification (e.g., "Sorry, I didn’t understand that, could you please repeat your command?").  
   - Certain commands that are more complex or outside the basic scope (e.g., multi-step adjustments) may result in limited functionality or require further user input.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - The requested vehicle setting is successfully adjusted, and the user is notified of the change (either through voice feedback or visual confirmation).  
   - If the command cannot be executed or is not fully understood, the system will request clarification and will not make changes until the user provides a clearer command.  
   - If the system is unable to process the voice command due to system limitations (e.g., feature unavailability, system failure), the user is given an alternative course of action (e.g., manual adjustments).  
   - The system returns to an idle state after the command is completed or after the user decides to end the interaction.
