**Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System** – Technical Specifications

---

**2. Functional Description**

The Enhanced Emergency Evacuation System is intended to facilitate the rapid and safe evacuation of occupants in case of emergency situations such as vehicle collisions, fire, or smoke detection. The system triggers automatic unlocking of doors, windows, and other exit points, while also activating emergency lighting and audible alerts to guide occupants to safety. Additionally, the system may provide evacuation assistance through visual or voice prompts. However, as this version is partially compliant, certain features may not be available or fully functional in all scenarios.

**3. Enabling Conditions**

- The system is designed to function in vehicles with operational emergency sensors, such as crash detection and smoke detection systems.
- The vehicle's electrical and power systems must be active, including backup systems for essential evacuation components like lighting and door unlocking.
- Emergency communication channels, including vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-cloud capabilities for alerting emergency services, should be available, though not guaranteed in all versions.
- User must be within the vehicle and able to interact with manual triggers or the system interface if automatic detection is not functioning.

**4. Trigger Conditions**

- The system is triggered by emergency conditions detected by the vehicle’s onboard sensors (e.g., crash, fire, smoke, or abnormal heat).
- Manual activation by the user through an emergency button or connected mobile application.
- In the event of sensor failure or malfunction, the system may not trigger automatically, and manual intervention may be required.

**5. Execution Output**

- **System Activation**: Upon triggering an emergency, the system attempts the following actions:
  1. Automatic unlocking of all doors and windows, including child safety locks if applicable.
  2. Activation of audible alerts (such as sirens or voice instructions) to notify occupants of the emergency and evacuation need.
  3. Turning on emergency lighting and hazard lights to aid occupants in finding safe exits.
  4. Providing visual or voice-guided evacuation instructions to assist users in exiting the vehicle if required.
  
  **Mismatch**: Due to the system’s partial compliance, features like voice guidance or real-time evacuation mapping may not be available in certain versions or under specific conditions.

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**

- **Exit Condition**: The system completes the evacuation process when all occupants have safely exited the vehicle.
- **Post-Event Condition**: After evacuation, the system resets to a normal operational state, awaiting the next use. If the system fails to trigger properly, manual intervention may be required, and occupants may need to rely on other emergency systems for escape.
- **Mismatch**: In case of system failure, the vehicle may not fully log the evacuation event or reset the system to its initial state, as required by the specifications.
