**1. Title**  
Automatic System Reset for Vehicle In-Car Tech  

---

**2. Functional Description**  
The Automatic System Reset for Vehicle In-Car Tech is a feature designed to autonomously detect and resolve malfunctions, freezes, or crashes within the vehicle’s in-car technology systems (such as infotainment, navigation, and connectivity modules). This subsystem automatically initiates a reset procedure to restore normal system function without requiring user intervention. It ensures continuous operation by recovering from software failures or temporary issues, thus providing a seamless driving experience. The system operates by detecting anomalies, executing a reset, and verifying successful recovery.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle's in-car technology system must be powered on and operational.  
- The system must be equipped with diagnostic capabilities to monitor the health of in-car technology modules.  
- The Automatic System Reset feature must be activated in the vehicle’s settings, either by default or through user configuration.  
- The in-car technology system must be compatible with automatic reset protocols (including software recovery capabilities).  
- The vehicle's software version must support the Automatic System Reset feature and be up-to-date.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- A system failure or freeze is detected within any core in-car technology module (e.g., infotainment, navigation, connectivity).  
- User input or interaction fails to restore normal functionality (e.g., the infotainment screen becomes unresponsive to touch or button commands).  
- The vehicle’s diagnostic system identifies a software crash or critical malfunction in the in-car tech system.  
- The system experiences an error or loss of connectivity that requires a reset to restore normal function.  
- A known software issue, as indicated by the vehicle's error logs, triggers an automatic reset.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Upon detecting a failure, the system will automatically initiate a reset sequence for the affected in-car tech module.  
- The system displays a notification on the vehicle’s dashboard or infotainment screen to inform the user that a reset is in progress.  
- The reset process is executed, and the affected system (e.g., infotainment, navigation) is restored to normal operation, including recovery from freezes or malfunctions.  
- If the reset is successful, the system confirms normal operation with a message stating the issue has been resolved.  
- If the reset is unsuccessful, the system logs the failure and generates an alert for the user to follow manual intervention procedures (e.g., restart the vehicle or contact support).  

---

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The in-car technology system has returned to its normal, operational state, responding to user inputs without delay or error.  
- The reset process completes successfully, and no further errors are detected in the system.  
- In case of a failed reset, the system prompts the user to take manual action (e.g., restarting the vehicle or seeking service).  
- The system logs the reset attempt and provides diagnostic information to assist with future troubleshooting.  
- If no further issues are detected, the system returns to full functionality and the user can resume interaction with the vehicle’s in-car tech systems without further interruption.
