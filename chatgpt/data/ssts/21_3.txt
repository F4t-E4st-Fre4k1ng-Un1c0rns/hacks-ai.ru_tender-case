**Technical Specifications: Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control**

**1. Title:**
Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control

**2. Functional Description:**
The Automatic Driver Identification and Access Control sub-system is designed to authenticate and authorize the driver to operate the vehicle based on predefined biometric data or access credentials. It utilizes facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, or an access card reader to identify the driver. Once the identification is successful, the system unlocks the vehicle and enables operation. This system ensures that only authorized users can operate the luxury electric vehicle, providing a seamless and secure access experience.

**3. Enabling Conditions:**
- The sub-system must be installed and configured in the vehicle with the necessary hardware components, including sensors for facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, or card reading.
- The vehicle’s system must be operational, and the sub-system must be properly integrated with the vehicle’s electrical and security systems.
- The driver’s biometric data or access credentials must be pre-registered into the system through the vehicle's user interface or during the initial setup.
- The vehicle must be in "Ready" mode, with all essential systems powered and operational.
- The sub-system requires continuous access to vehicle power and system resources for proper function.

**4. Trigger Conditions:**
- The sub-system is activated when the driver approaches the vehicle, detected by proximity sensors.
- The system prompts the driver to present their identifying feature (e.g., face for facial recognition, finger for fingerprint scan, or swipe of the access card).
- If the system detects an authentication failure, it will automatically prompt the driver to use an alternative verification method, such as a PIN code or mobile verification, if configured.

**5. Execution Output:**
- Upon successful identification, the system unlocks the vehicle doors and enables the driver to start the vehicle.
- A log of successful and failed authentication attempts is stored within the vehicle’s onboard system for security auditing purposes.
- If identification fails repeatedly, the system disables further access attempts and alerts the driver to seek alternative verification methods.
- The system will send a notification if an authentication failure reaches the defined threshold, prompting the driver to contact customer support.

**6. Exit Conditions:**
- The sub-system exits when the driver is successfully authenticated, and access to the vehicle is granted, or when the authentication fails and no further attempts are allowed.
- If the vehicle's hardware malfunctions or if the system cannot authenticate the driver, the system will exit the authentication process and reset for the next session.
- The sub-system will also exit if alternative authentication methods fail or if the user is locked out, transitioning to a support contact interface for further assistance.
