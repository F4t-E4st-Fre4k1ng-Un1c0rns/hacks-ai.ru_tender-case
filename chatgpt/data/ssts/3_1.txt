Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization (Fully Compliant)

---

**2. Functional Description**  
The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) System Customization allows users to personalize the vehicle's adaptive cruise control settings, enhancing the driving experience. This system enables the driver to adjust parameters such as following distance, acceleration sensitivity, and deceleration behavior. The customizations are stored and retained in the system for future trips. The ACC system dynamically adjusts the vehicle's speed based on traffic conditions, while the customization feature allows users to fine-tune the vehicle's response to these conditions.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle is equipped with functional radar, camera sensors, and other necessary hardware for ACC operation.
- The vehicle's firmware is up to date and supports ACC Customization features.
- The driver is seated in the driver's seat, and the vehicle is in operational mode (engine running, vehicle in drive mode).
- The vehicle must be operating under conditions where ACC functionality is possible (clear road visibility, traffic conditions that allow for ACC use).
- The ACC system is activated through the user interface, either from the steering wheel controls or infotainment system.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The driver activates the Adaptive Cruise Control system either manually or through the vehicle's steering wheel control.
- The vehicle detects appropriate traffic conditions (e.g., vehicle speed, proximity to other vehicles) to enable ACC functionality.
- The driver accesses the ACC customization menu either through the vehicle’s infotainment system or mobile app.
- A valid user input is received, such as selecting a following distance or adjusting sensitivity preferences.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Once customization options are selected, the system updates the ACC settings according to the user’s preferences. 
- The system modifies the following distance, acceleration, and deceleration sensitivity to match the driver’s input.
- The ACC system actively controls the vehicle's speed, maintaining the chosen following distance and adapting to changes in traffic conditions.
- The system continuously monitors sensor data to ensure that the ACC functionality operates according to the set parameters.
- Customization settings are saved in the system and retained until manually adjusted by the user or reset to default.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The ACC system operates according to the newly customized settings until the system is turned off or the vehicle is shut down.
- If the system encounters an error (e.g., sensor malfunction), it will notify the user, and ACC will deactivate until the issue is resolved.
- If the system is deactivated (e.g., the driver manually disables ACC or changes driving modes), the customization settings will be retained and applied when ACC is reactivated.
- The system enters a fallback mode in case of extreme environmental conditions (e.g., heavy rain or fog), where ACC may temporarily be disabled, and the user is notified of the unavailability of the system.
