### 1. Title  
Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring

---

### 2. Functional Description  
The **Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring** sub-system is designed to monitor the vehicle’s speed in real-time, compare it against the local speed limit, and provide timely alerts when the vehicle exceeds the allowed speed. The system will also log speed limit violations for future reference, integrate with the vehicle’s GPS and driver assistance systems, and update speed limits as the vehicle moves along different routes.

Key functional components include:
- Real-time speed limit detection and monitoring.
- Auditory and visual alerts for speed violations.
- Logging of speed violations and compliance status.
- Integration with GPS and mapping systems to provide accurate speed limit data.
- Interaction with cruise control and automated driving features for compliance enforcement.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle must have a properly functioning GPS system capable of providing real-time location data.
- Speed sensors must be calibrated to accurately measure the vehicle’s speed.
- The system must be integrated with the vehicle’s infotainment system for displaying visual alerts and providing auditory feedback (beeps or sounds).
- During initial setup, the system must be configured to properly interface with other vehicle subsystems, including cruise control and automated speed regulation.
- A valid speed limit database must be accessible through the system, enabling the sub-system to update speed limits dynamically based on the vehicle's location.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The vehicle is in motion, and the ignition is turned on.
- GPS data is available and the system detects the vehicle's current location, fetching the relevant speed limit for that area.
- The vehicle's speed exceeds the locally posted speed limit, triggering a violation alert.
- A failure in GPS data or loss of connectivity occurs, triggering an error message regarding speed limit monitoring.

---

### 5. Execution Output  
- When the vehicle’s speed exceeds the posted speed limit, the system will activate an auditory alert (beep) and display a visual alert (e.g., flashing light or message) on the dashboard.
- If the vehicle’s speed is reduced to within the legal limit, the system will cease the alert and return to normal monitoring.
- Speed limit violations are logged with timestamps and vehicle location for potential review.
- The system will update the speed limit information automatically as the vehicle passes through different regions.
- If GPS signal is lost or there is a system malfunction, an error message will be displayed on the dashboard, informing the driver of the issue (e.g., "Speed Limit Monitoring Unavailable" or "GPS Signal Lost").

---

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The system will stop monitoring if the vehicle is stationary or parked for a prolonged period (e.g., ignition turned off or vehicle in park).
- If the driver manually overrides or disables the speed limit monitoring system through the vehicle’s settings, the system will exit monitoring mode.
- The system will automatically deactivate if the GPS signal is lost for an extended period, resulting in an inability to update speed limits.
- Upon a critical system failure (e.g., malfunction in speed sensors), the system will log the error and cease operation until the issue is resolved.
- The system will reset and resume monitoring once the GPS signal is reestablished or the vehicle is restarted.
