**Technical Specifications: User Authentication and Authorization for Car Access**  

**1. Title**  
User Authentication and Authorization for Car Access  

**2. Functional description**  
The User Authentication and Authorization for Car Access subsystem is designed to provide secure access to a luxury electric car by verifying the identity of the user through various authentication methods. The system will ensure that only authorized users can interact with the car's features based on their predefined roles (Owner, Driver, Guest). Authentication can include methods such as passwords and biometric verification, while authorization defines the level of access granted to each user. The subsystem will also log all user access attempts for security auditing and monitoring purposes.  

**3. Enabling conditions**  
- The user must have a registered account with the car manufacturer’s system, including a valid email, password, and associated vehicle(s).  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary hardware and software to communicate with the authentication system, supporting either Bluetooth, mobile apps, or digital key interfaces.  
- The system must support at least one secure authentication method, such as a password, fingerprint recognition, or facial recognition, to verify the identity of users.  
- The system requires internet connectivity to perform real-time authentication and validation of user credentials, although offline authentication may be available in certain cases.  
- User roles (Owner, Driver, Guest) and their respective permissions must be defined and configurable.  

**4. Trigger conditions**  
- A user initiates access to the car's systems through a mobile app, key fob, or digital interface.  
- The system detects an attempt to unlock the car, start the vehicle, or access its settings.  
- The system identifies the need to verify a user’s identity, either by password entry, biometric scan, or other authorized method.  
- The system detects access from a new or unrecognized device or location, triggering additional security checks.  
- A potential security breach, such as an unusual access attempt, is detected, activating fallback security measures.  

**5. Execution output**  
- If the user is authenticated successfully, the system grants access to the car’s features based on the user’s role and permissions (e.g., Owner, Driver, Guest).  
- The system generates access logs that include the time, date, and actions performed by the authenticated user. These logs are stored for auditing and security monitoring.  
- If authentication fails, the system will notify the user of the failed attempt and provide options for recovery, such as password reset or an alternate verification method.  
- If unauthorized access is detected, the system will deny access and notify the user and relevant security teams of the attempt.  
- The system will log all failed and successful access attempts to maintain a comprehensive security record.  

**6. Exit conditions**  
- After successful authentication, the user gains access to the car’s features as per their assigned role and can interact with the vehicle.  
- The car’s system will automatically lock the car and its features once the user exits or after a predefined inactivity timeout period.  
- The system logs the exit event, including the time and user actions, ensuring all access is recorded for security purposes.  
- If the user terminates their session, the system ensures that no unauthorized users can access the vehicle until new authentication occurs.
