**2. Functional Description**  
The On-Demand Charging for Electric Vehicles (EV) sub-System allows users to request, manage, and monitor the charging of their electric vehicles via a mobile application. The system provides users with access to available charging stations, enables the scheduling of charging sessions, and sends real-time updates on the progress of the charge. The sub-System is designed to support charging at home, public, and destination stations, with the ability to handle different levels of charging power and vehicle compatibility. It also provides a seamless experience by integrating vehicle status, payment handling, and user notifications.
