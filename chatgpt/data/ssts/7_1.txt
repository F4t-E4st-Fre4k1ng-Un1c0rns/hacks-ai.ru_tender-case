**Technical Specifications: AI-based Driver Assistance for Hazard Detection**

1. **Title**  
   AI-based Driver Assistance for Hazard Detection

2. **Functional Description**  
   The AI-based Driver Assistance for Hazard Detection sub-system is designed to monitor the vehicle’s surroundings in real time using an array of sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar. It analyzes this sensor data to detect potential hazards such as pedestrians, other vehicles, obstacles, and environmental factors (e.g., slippery surfaces, sharp curves). The system will alert the driver through audio, visual, and haptic feedback if a hazard is detected, allowing sufficient time for the driver to react and take necessary action to avoid potential collisions. The system aims to increase driving safety by providing timely hazard warnings.

3. **Enabling Conditions**  
   - The vehicle must be equipped with functional sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar, with proper calibration for accurate hazard detection.
   - The AI hazard detection system must be integrated into the vehicle’s onboard computer and be capable of processing sensor data in real-time.
   - The vehicle must have the latest software updates for the hazard detection system installed.
   - The system must be activated through the vehicle’s interface by the driver.
   - The vehicle must be operating in conditions that allow for hazard detection (e.g., clear visibility, no obstructions in the sensor’s field of view, functioning environmental systems like wipers for cameras).

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - A potential hazard, such as a pedestrian, another vehicle, an obstacle, or a road condition (e.g., slippery surface, sharp turn), is detected by the sensors.
   - The hazard detection algorithms process the sensor data and identify a potential risk of collision based on proximity and speed.
   - The system detects that the vehicle is approaching a hazardous situation at a distance or speed that requires immediate or cautionary intervention.

5. **Execution Output**  
   - Upon detecting a hazard, the system will trigger one or more of the following alerts to the driver:
     - **Audio Alert**: A warning sound, such as a beep or chime, to alert the driver to the presence of a hazard.
     - **Visual Alert**: A visual notification displayed on the dashboard or heads-up display, indicating the type of hazard and its location.
     - **Haptic Feedback**: A vibration in the steering wheel or seat to draw the driver’s attention to the hazard.
   - In case of an imminent hazard, the system may provide additional corrective guidance, such as a prompt to brake or steer.
   - Hazard data (type, location, and severity) will be logged for future system analysis and optimization.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - The system will cease issuing alerts once the hazard has been avoided or the vehicle has passed beyond the hazardous zone.
   - If the driver manually deactivates the system, no further hazard alerts will be provided.
   - In case of system failure (e.g., sensor malfunction), the system will notify the driver and enter a degraded mode with limited hazard detection capabilities.
   - If the hazard detection system encounters an obstruction or degradation in sensor performance, the system will alert the driver and continue monitoring the surroundings at a reduced level of sensitivity until functionality is restored.
