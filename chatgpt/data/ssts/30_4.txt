### 1. **Title**  
   **In-Car Remote Diagnostics for Technical Support**

---

### 2. **Functional Description**  
   The In-Car Remote Diagnostics for Technical Support sub-system enables real-time, remote vehicle diagnostics. This system is designed to monitor vehicle performance, detect technical issues, and provide diagnostic feedback directly to the user or technical support personnel. The system supports both automatic and manual diagnostics, offering detailed reports on system health and troubleshooting recommendations. In cases where remote resolution is not possible, the system will offer the user a seamless pathway to schedule in-person service. The system ensures high levels of accuracy and reliability by utilizing comprehensive vehicle sensor data and maintaining strong communication with remote servers.

### 3. **Enabling Conditions**  
   - **Vehicle Compatibility**: The vehicle must be equipped with the required hardware, including diagnostic sensors and communication interfaces, and must be running the latest software version to support remote diagnostics.
   - **Network Connectivity**: An active, stable internet connection (via cellular data or Wi-Fi) is required for full functionality of the remote diagnostics system. The system will notify the user if the connection is weak or interrupted.
   - **User Authentication**: The user must have a registered account with the manufacturer’s technical support platform. Proper authentication is required before initiating diagnostics.
   - **Data Access**: The vehicle’s sensors and internal systems must be fully operational and accessible by the remote diagnostic platform. The system can detect and report failures in critical sensors or components.
   - **System Availability**: The remote diagnostic service must be operational, with backup server systems in place to handle traffic and ensure continuous availability.

### 4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - **Vehicle Error Notification**: A vehicle error message (e.g., warning lights or fault codes on the dashboard) automatically triggers a recommendation for a diagnostic scan. The system will initiate a diagnostic process automatically when such alerts are detected.
   - **Manual Request**: The user can manually initiate a diagnostic scan via the in-car infotainment system or the dedicated mobile app at any time.  
   - **Preventive Maintenance Reminder**: The system will also trigger a diagnostic scan automatically at predefined intervals or based on accumulated mileage to ensure preventive maintenance checks are performed regularly.

### 5. **Execution Output**  
   - **Diagnostic Results**: After performing the diagnostic scan, the system generates a detailed report outlining the condition of the vehicle, including any issues detected with sensors, components, or software. The report will categorize problems based on severity and provide clear descriptions of possible causes.
   - **Recommendations**: The system provides actionable recommendations, including instructions for simple remote fixes, if applicable. For example, resetting certain systems or recalibrating sensors.
   - **Remote Fixes**: If applicable, the system will automatically attempt minor remote fixes, such as resetting software or recalibrating sensors, to resolve minor faults without requiring user intervention.
   - **Scheduled Service**: If the issue cannot be resolved remotely, the system offers the user an option to schedule an in-person appointment with an authorized service center, providing the nearest locations and available time slots.

### 6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - **Completed Diagnostic Scan**: Upon successful completion of the diagnostic scan, the system will notify the user with a confirmation message and provide a summary of the findings. The user will have access to detailed information via the mobile app or in-car display.
   - **Resolved Issues**: If the diagnostic identifies an issue that can be resolved remotely, the system will execute the necessary fixes and confirm that the issue has been addressed. The user will receive a notification that the problem has been resolved.
   - **Service Appointment Scheduled**: If the issue requires in-person service, the system will successfully schedule the appointment and confirm the user’s details. The user will receive a notification with the date, time, and location of the service appointment.
   - **Failure Notification**: If the system encounters an issue during the diagnostic process (e.g., network failure, communication error), the user will receive a clear failure notification with suggestions for next steps, such as retrying the diagnostic or contacting customer support.
