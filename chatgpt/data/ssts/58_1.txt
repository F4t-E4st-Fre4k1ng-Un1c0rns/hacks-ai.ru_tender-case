**1. Title**  
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication Integration

---

**2. Functional Description**  
The V2I Communication Integration system enables seamless interaction between a luxury electric vehicle and surrounding infrastructure, such as traffic lights, road signs, and charging stations. The system allows the vehicle to receive and send real-time data to these infrastructure components, providing enhanced driving capabilities like optimized traffic light navigation, hazard detection, and charging station availability. The system aims to improve safety, reduce driving time, and increase operational efficiency for the driver by offering up-to-date, location-based information.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with compatible V2I communication hardware and software, such as DSRC or C-V2X.
- The infrastructure (traffic lights, road signs, charging stations) must support V2I communication protocols and be in working order.
- A secure communication network must be available to facilitate real-time data exchange between the vehicle and infrastructure.
- The V2I system must be activated by the driver or automatically upon vehicle start-up.
- The V2I system requires geographical coverage in urban or connected areas where infrastructure is equipped to communicate with vehicles.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The vehicle enters an area covered by V2I-enabled infrastructure, such as an intersection with smart traffic signals or a nearby charging station.
- The vehicle speed drops or approaches optimal thresholds for communication with traffic signals or safety alerts.
- The vehicle's navigation system identifies a route requiring V2I communication, such as a detour due to a road hazard or congestion.
- The vehicle enters a zone where hazard alerts are triggered by the surrounding infrastructure (e.g., construction zones or accidents).
- The vehicle approaches a charging station that is part of the V2I network, triggering information about station availability and status.

**5. Execution Output**  
- Real-time data on the traffic light status (e.g., green, yellow, red) is provided, enabling optimized driving behavior.
- Notifications regarding road conditions, such as accidents or construction zones, are sent to the driver to adjust the route or speed accordingly.
- Charging station information, including availability, operational status, and charging capacity, is displayed to help the driver make an informed decision about stopping for a charge.
- The system displays relevant updates and alerts on the vehicle’s infotainment or dashboard, ensuring that the driver is well-informed and can take action if needed.
- All V2I interactions are logged for diagnostic and future system optimization purposes.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system deactivates when the vehicle exits the V2I-enabled infrastructure area or moves out of communication range.
- Communication with the infrastructure stops in case of a signal loss, system failure, or when the vehicle is no longer in the vicinity of V2I-enabled infrastructure.
- The V2I system automatically deactivates when the vehicle is powered off or parked.
- The system returns to standard vehicle operation without V2I features if communication is lost or unavailable, allowing the driver to continue without the enhanced features.
- Upon reaching the destination or when the driver manually disables the system, the V2I communication system exits.
