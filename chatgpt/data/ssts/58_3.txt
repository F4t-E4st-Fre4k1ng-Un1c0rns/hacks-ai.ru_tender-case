**Technical Specifications for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication Integration**

1. **Title**  
   Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication Integration

2. **Functional Description**  
   The Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication Integration sub-system allows communication between the electric vehicle (EV) and surrounding infrastructure such as traffic signals, charging stations, and road sensors. This sub-system provides features like traffic light adjustments based on vehicle proximity, live route optimizations, real-time updates on charging station availability, and alerts about potential road hazards. The system is designed to enhance driving safety, efficiency, and convenience by enabling seamless data exchange between the vehicle and infrastructure elements.

3. **Enabling Conditions**  
   - The vehicle must be equipped with V2I-compatible communication hardware, such as DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communication) or 5G modules.
   - The surrounding infrastructure (traffic lights, charging stations, road sensors) must support V2I communication protocols, including IEEE 802.11p or C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything).
   - A reliable communication network (e.g., 5G, DSRC) is required for continuous data exchange between the vehicle and infrastructure.
   - The vehicle’s V2I system must be activated at the start of each journey via the vehicle’s central control unit.
   - Vehicle and infrastructure must implement necessary security protocols (e.g., encryption, authentication) to ensure data privacy and integrity.

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - The vehicle enters the communication range of an infrastructure element (e.g., a traffic signal, charging station, or road sensor).
   - The vehicle initiates a connection with the surrounding infrastructure by enabling the V2I communication feature through the dashboard or vehicle control unit.
   - The vehicle’s system detects an event requiring real-time communication with the infrastructure, such as approaching a traffic light, encountering roadwork, or needing charging.
   - The surrounding infrastructure (e.g., traffic lights, charging stations) broadcasts relevant data, such as the availability of a charging slot or the status of a traffic light.

5. **Execution Output**  
   - The vehicle adjusts its speed in real-time to optimize for green lights or to minimize stop-and-go traffic, ensuring smooth transitions at intersections.
   - The system provides navigation adjustments or route suggestions based on live data from road sensors, ensuring a more efficient travel path.
   - The vehicle notifies the driver of nearby available charging stations and their status (e.g., occupied or available), helping to plan charging stops.
   - Real-time hazard alerts, such as road construction or accidents, are displayed to the driver, along with potential rerouting suggestions when necessary.
   - The vehicle’s energy consumption is optimized by syncing with infrastructure that supports energy-efficient protocols, reducing unnecessary power use.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - The communication between the vehicle and infrastructure is interrupted, either because the vehicle leaves the communication range or due to a network failure.
   - The user disables the V2I system via the vehicle’s dashboard or settings, or the system automatically shuts down due to a system error or malfunction.
   - The vehicle completes its journey and exits the V2I-enabled area, with all data exchanges successfully concluded.
   - If a communication failure occurs, the system attempts to reconnect, but the feature may be temporarily disabled until the connection is reestablished or the system is manually restarted.
