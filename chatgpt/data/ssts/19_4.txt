### 2. Functional Description
The Vehicle Health Monitoring with Automated Reports sub-system is designed to provide continuous monitoring of a vehicle's health. This includes real-time diagnostics of various vehicle systems, including battery status, motor performance, tire pressure, and overall vehicle health. The sub-system will automatically generate detailed reports based on periodic health checks and trigger alerts for any detected issues requiring immediate attention. The reports will be accessible via the vehicle's mobile app or dashboard interface, and users will receive notifications about critical issues or necessary maintenance actions.

### 4. Trigger Conditions
- Scheduled periodic health checks triggered based on the user’s configuration (e.g., weekly, monthly).
- Detection of a vehicle health issue or anomaly, such as low tire pressure, battery degradation, or motor performance issues.
- User manual initiation of a health report request via the app or dashboard interface.
- Connectivity issues or failure to synchronize data will trigger an automatic retry mechanism, notifying the user of the delay.

### 5. Execution Output
- Upon executing a health check or report request, the sub-system generates a detailed report summarizing the vehicle's health, including performance metrics, detected issues, and recommended actions.
- Automated notifications will be sent to the user if critical issues are detected, such as the need for immediate maintenance or potential failure risks.
- Reports will be accessible through the vehicle’s app or dashboard interface, providing the user with an easy-to-read summary of the vehicle's health status.
- In case of system failures or communication issues, the system will notify the user and allow them to manually retry or resolve the issue through customer support options.

### 6. Exit Conditions
- After a successful health check or report generation, the system will update the vehicle’s health records and provide a confirmation to the user that the report is available.
- If a critical issue is detected, the system will provide detailed instructions on how to proceed, including scheduling maintenance or contacting support.
- If the system encounters an error or connectivity issue, the user will be notified and advised to attempt the action again later or contact customer support for assistance.
