Technical Specifications for Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization

**1. Functional Description:**  
The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) System Customization feature allows drivers to tailor the behavior of the ACC system according to their personal preferences. It provides the ability to adjust the speed sensitivity, following distance, and the responsiveness of the system to surrounding traffic. This customization ensures the vehicle adapts to the driver’s preferred driving style, improving comfort and safety. The system will also automatically adjust the vehicle's speed based on traffic conditions, maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles while keeping within the driver’s set parameters.

**2. Enabling Conditions:**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with an operational Adaptive Cruise Control system, properly calibrated for use.  
- The vehicle should be in motion, and the road conditions must be clear and free of obstacles that may interfere with ACC functionality (e.g., clear lanes, no road closures).  
- The system should be available for activation, with no ongoing malfunctions or error warnings indicating the ACC is disabled.  
- The driver must have access to the infotainment system or steering wheel controls to customize the ACC settings.  
- The vehicle's speed should be within a range that allows for the activation of the ACC system (typically above a minimum speed threshold).

**3. Trigger Conditions:**  
- The driver manually activates the Adaptive Cruise Control system through the vehicle’s dashboard controls or steering wheel buttons.  
- The ACC system detects the current traffic conditions, adjusts the vehicle's speed, and engages based on the road and traffic environment.  
- The driver accesses the ACC customization menu via the infotainment system and selects their desired preferences for sensitivity and following distance.  
- The system triggers automatic adjustments based on traffic behavior, such as slowing down or accelerating to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.

**4. Execution Output:**  
- Once activated, the ACC system automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed to maintain the selected following distance and responds to traffic conditions.  
- The driver’s selected preferences (speed sensitivity, following distance) are immediately applied to the system, and the vehicle’s speed is controlled accordingly.  
- The system provides visual feedback via the infotainment display or dashboard, showing the current settings and any adjustments made.  
- If the system detects a need for recalibration based on traffic changes, it will automatically adjust the vehicle’s speed or following distance in real time.  
- The system will provide feedback on whether the changes were successfully applied, using visual or auditory signals to confirm user inputs.

**5. Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions:**  
- The ACC system will automatically disengage when the vehicle reaches a full stop or if the driver manually disengages the system via the dashboard or steering wheel controls.  
- The system exits when road conditions change in such a way that ACC is no longer viable (e.g., entering an off-road area, road signs indicating a hazardous condition).  
- If the ACC system detects a malfunction or error (such as a failure in sensor functionality), it will disengage, and the driver will be alerted via an on-screen notification or audio alert.  
- The system will disengage if the vehicle reaches a speed too low for the ACC to function effectively or if the vehicle is in a situation where ACC cannot maintain control (e.g., heavy stop-and-go traffic).  
- The system will exit when the vehicle is manually steered out of the defined lane or if an external event (such as pressing the brake pedal or shifting gears) requires immediate system deactivation.
