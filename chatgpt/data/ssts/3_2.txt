**1. Title**  
Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization

**2. Functional description**  
The Adaptive Cruise Control System Customization allows the user to configure and personalize the behavior of the vehicle's adaptive cruise control feature. This customization includes adjusting the following distance, acceleration and deceleration sensitivity, speed threshold, and the system's response to varying road conditions. The system is designed to adapt to the driver’s preferences, providing a more tailored and responsive driving experience.

**3. Enabling conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with an operational Adaptive Cruise Control system.  
- The vehicle must be running the latest software version of the Adaptive Cruise Control system.  
- The user must have access to the vehicle's main control interface (dashboard, touchscreen, or other input method).  
- The vehicle must be in motion with the system activated for customization.  
- Environmental conditions must allow for safe customization (e.g., no inclement weather conditions that could impair sensor functionality).  

**4. Trigger conditions**  
- The user selects the "Adaptive Cruise Control Customization" option from the vehicle’s main control interface.  
- The vehicle enters an operational mode where adaptive cruise control can be safely adjusted while driving (speed range, road conditions).  
- A valid driver profile is present, and the system recognizes the driver's preferences or settings.  
- The system detects changes in road conditions that may trigger adjustments to the customization, such as traffic density or road curvature.  

**5. Execution output:**  
- The system processes the user's input and adjusts the adaptive cruise control settings accordingly.  
- The following distance, acceleration/deceleration sensitivity, and speed thresholds are recalibrated based on the user’s preferences.  
- Feedback is provided to the user through the interface, confirming that the new settings have been successfully applied.  
- The system continues to adjust its behavior dynamically, maintaining the new settings during operation, ensuring smooth integration with the road and traffic conditions.

**6. Exit conditions**  
- The user successfully saves and exits the customization settings, and the system operates with the new preferences.  
- The system reverts to the default settings if the user cancels the customization process.  
- The customization interface exits if the system encounters an error, such as a sensor malfunction or software issue, requiring the user to perform troubleshooting steps.  
- The system enters a fallback mode if the conditions necessary for customization are not met (e.g., if the vehicle is stopped or if environmental factors limit system functionality).
