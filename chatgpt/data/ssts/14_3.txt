**Technical Specifications: Multi-User Profile Management for Vehicle Settings**

**1. Title:**
Multi-User Profile Management for Vehicle Settings

**2. Functional Description:**
The Multi-User Profile Management system allows multiple users to create, manage, and load personalized vehicle settings, including seat position, mirror alignment, climate control preferences, driving modes, and infotainment settings. The system is designed to detect the currently active user, load their respective profile, and automatically adjust the vehicle settings to match those preferences. If a profile is not available, users are prompted to create a new profile or proceed with default settings. The system also saves any adjustments made to the settings during the session to ensure the profile is always up to date.

**3. Enabling Conditions:**
- The vehicle must be equipped with an infotainment system capable of supporting multiple user profiles.
- The user must be authenticated through a compatible identification method (e.g., key fob, biometric recognition, or PIN).
- The vehicle’s system must be up-to-date with the necessary software to handle profile management functionalities.
- The user’s profile must be pre-registered in the vehicle’s database or linked to an external account (e.g., smartphone app).
- The vehicle must have the necessary hardware installed to support seat position, mirror settings, climate controls, and infotainment preferences based on user profiles.

**4. Trigger Conditions:**
- The system detects that a user has entered the vehicle and attempts to interact with the infotainment system.
- The system detects a linked user profile via Bluetooth, key fob, or biometric recognition when the user attempts to access the vehicle.
- The user initiates a manual selection of their profile from the available list.
- A failure occurs while loading the user profile, triggering an error notification or a fallback to default settings.

**5. Execution Output:**
- Upon successful detection or selection, the system loads the user’s profile, adjusting vehicle settings such as seat position, mirror position, climate control, and driving mode to the user’s predefined preferences.
- If the user makes changes to the settings during their session, the system automatically saves the adjustments to the active profile upon exit.
- If the user’s profile cannot be loaded (e.g., due to an error), the system prompts the user to either retry loading the profile, create a new profile, or use default settings.
- If a new profile is created or an existing profile is updated, the system confirms the changes and saves them for future use.

**6. Exit Conditions:**
- The system successfully saves any adjustments made to the user’s settings during the session to the corresponding profile.
- The user exits the vehicle, and the profile system retains the latest settings for future use.
- If a new profile was created, the system prompts the user to confirm the details before finalizing and saving the profile.
- In the event of an error or system malfunction, the system alerts the user to potential issues and offers the option to retry or use default settings.
