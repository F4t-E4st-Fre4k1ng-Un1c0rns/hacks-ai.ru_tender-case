Integrating Emergency Alerts in Vehicle Dashboard

---

**2. Functional Description**  
The Integrating Emergency Alerts in Vehicle Dashboard sub-system is designed to deliver real-time emergency alerts to the vehicle's dashboard interface. These alerts will include critical information about potential hazards, accidents, weather conditions, or vehicle malfunctions. The system will provide actionable recommendations for the driver, such as changes in speed, detours, or safety precautions. The alert system will work seamlessly with external data sources like emergency services and weather monitoring systems, ensuring that alerts are delivered to the vehicle in real-time. The dashboard interface will display these alerts in a clear, easily readable format to ensure that the driver can respond appropriately to any emergency situation.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle is equipped with a compatible dashboard system capable of displaying dynamic content and integrating with external systems.
- The vehicle must have an active communication network (e.g., 4G/5G, Wi-Fi) for receiving emergency alerts from local authorities, weather services, or vehicle sensors.
- The emergency alert feature must be enabled in the vehicle’s settings.
- The vehicle must have access to real-time data sources, such as local emergency services and weather monitoring systems, to receive emergency alerts.
- The alert system must be operational and able to interface with the vehicle's main communication network.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- Detection of an emergency situation, such as a road hazard, accident, weather alert, or vehicle malfunction, based on data from external services or the vehicle’s internal sensors.
- A warning or alert message is received from emergency services, weather systems, or other external sources related to the vehicle’s location.
- The vehicle enters a dangerous zone or high-risk area, based on geolocation data.
- A vehicle malfunction (e.g., tire pressure drop, engine failure) triggers an alert to the driver.

**5. Execution Output**  
Upon the detection of an emergency, the system will:
- Display the emergency alert on the dashboard screen, including key details such as the type of emergency (e.g., road hazard, weather alert, accident), the severity level, and relevant safety recommendations.
- Provide specific instructions to the driver, such as detour routes, speed adjustments, or immediate actions to ensure safety.
- Use visual indicators (e.g., blinking icons, colored text) to draw attention to the alert and ensure the driver is promptly aware.
- Log the emergency alert and driver’s response in the vehicle’s system for future review or analysis.
- Once the alert is resolved, the system will return to normal operations.

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**  
- Once the emergency alert has been acknowledged by the driver or if the alert’s duration has expired, the system will clear the alert from the dashboard display.
- The system will return to the regular vehicle interface once the emergency situation has passed or been resolved.
- If the emergency alert system detects a resolution of the emergency or receives updated information indicating the alert is no longer valid, the system will deactivate the alert.
- In the case of a system or connectivity failure, the driver will be notified with an error message, and the system will attempt to reconnect or resume normal operation once the issue is resolved. If the issue persists, the system will remain unavailable until connectivity is restored.
