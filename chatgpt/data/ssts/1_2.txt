### 2. Functional Description
The V2V Integration system enables direct communication between vehicles within a specified range, sharing key telemetry data such as speed, direction, and braking actions. This function aims to enhance driver awareness and response time to nearby hazards, optimizing safety and traffic efficiency. The system operates based on standard V2V communication protocols, supporting real-time alerts to drivers about potential safety risks.

### 3. Enabling Conditions
- Vehicles must be within a designated proximity range, typically influenced by environmental factors, for successful V2V connection.
- Both vehicles should have active V2V communication capabilities and support compatible protocols.
- Although not mandatory, stable external connectivity to cloud systems can improve performance and data processing speed.

### 4. Trigger Conditions
- The system activates upon detecting two or more equipped vehicles within the designated communication range.
- Trigger conditions include scenarios like approaching intersections, sudden braking events, or lane changes by nearby vehicles that may impact driving safety.

### 5. Execution Output
- The V2V system generates real-time alerts, communicating potential hazards and supporting driver decisions.
- Continuous monitoring of surrounding vehicles helps maintain situational awareness and can log data to enhance future driving insights.
- Under high data load or dense traffic, slight latency may occur in alert generation, potentially impacting the immediacy of the response.

### 6. Exit Conditions
- The system automatically disengages once the vehicles exit the communication range, or when detected hazards and interactions have been resolved.
- In cases of connectivity interruptions, manual reset may be required to return the V2V system to standby mode, otherwise, it will automatically await the next trigger event.
