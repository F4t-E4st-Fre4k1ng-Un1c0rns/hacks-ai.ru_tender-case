Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration Technical Specifications

---

**Functional Description:**  
The Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication system enables real-time data exchange between vehicles, facilitating improved situational awareness, collision avoidance, and traffic management. Through secure, short-range wireless communication, the V2V system transmits essential data such as speed, direction, braking status, and hazard alerts to surrounding V2V-enabled vehicles. This sub-system aims to enhance driver safety and optimize traffic flow while adhering to privacy and data security standards.

**Enabling Conditions:**  
- The vehicle must be operational and within the V2V communication range (up to 100 meters) of other compatible vehicles.
- Both vehicles involved in communication must have active V2V systems compliant with established communication protocols (e.g., DSRC or C-V2X).
- Adequate battery power and connectivity to the vehicle’s onboard sensors, GPS, and central processing unit (CPU) are required for effective data transmission.

**Trigger Conditions:**  
- Activation of the V2V system by the driver, either manually or automatically upon vehicle startup.
- Detection of nearby V2V-enabled vehicles within communication range.
- Situational triggers such as sudden braking, sharp changes in direction, or environmental hazards that prompt the system to broadcast alerts.

**Execution Output:**  
- **Normal Operation:** Continuous real-time exchange of speed, direction, and positioning data between vehicles. Relevant data is processed and presented to the driver via visual and audio alerts.
- **Alert Generation:** In cases of sudden braking or obstacle detection, the V2V system generates immediate warnings to surrounding vehicles, prompting a visual and/or audio alert on their dashboard interfaces.
- **Data Logging:** System records exchanged data for incident analysis and regulatory compliance (if applicable), adhering to data retention policies and privacy regulations.

**Exit Conditions:**  
- **Standard Exit:** The V2V system automatically deactivates when the vehicle is turned off or leaves the communication range of other V2V-enabled vehicles.
- **Manual Exit:** Driver can manually deactivate the V2V system, ceasing all data exchange and reverting to onboard vehicle sensors only.
- **Error Handling Exit:** In cases of connectivity loss, signal interference, or system malfunction, the V2V system will display an error message and pause communication until reconnected or reset.
