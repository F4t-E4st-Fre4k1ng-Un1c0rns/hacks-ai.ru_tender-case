#### **2. Functional Description**
The **Vehicle Health Monitoring with Automated Reports** sub-system provides continuous monitoring of critical vehicle components including the battery, motor, cooling system, tire pressure, and other key performance indicators. The system generates automated, detailed reports on the vehicle’s health status, offering real-time diagnostics, proactive maintenance suggestions, and alerts for any issues that require attention. These reports can be accessed by the user through a mobile app or in-vehicle display. The sub-system aims to enhance vehicle performance, improve maintenance scheduling, and reduce the risk of unexpected failures by offering actionable insights.

#### **3. Enabling Conditions**
- The vehicle must be equipped with the necessary sensors for monitoring key vehicle systems (battery, motor, tire pressure, cooling system, etc.).
- The system must be integrated with the vehicle's central diagnostic network, enabling seamless communication between the sensors and the onboard system.
- The system must have access to an active internet connection to enable remote diagnostics and automated report generation.
- A user interface (UI) must be available on both mobile devices (iOS/Android) and in-vehicle displays, providing the user with easy access to health reports and maintenance actions.
- Users must have a registered account linked to the vehicle system for tracking, managing, and receiving notifications regarding the health of their vehicle.

#### **4. Trigger Conditions**
- The system is triggered automatically upon vehicle startup, or when any monitored parameter (battery level, tire pressure, temperature) deviates from predefined safe operating thresholds.
- The user can manually initiate a health check by selecting the "Generate Health Report" option from the app or in-vehicle display.
- Scheduled periodic health checks may be triggered based on configurable time intervals (e.g., monthly or every 500 miles), ensuring routine diagnostics.
- The system will detect if any critical system failures occur (e.g., low battery, overheating) and automatically generate an alert to the user.
- If any sensors are offline or malfunctioning, the system will generate an error message and notify the user that a full health check cannot be performed.

#### **5. Execution Output**
- A detailed diagnostic report is generated, displaying the health status of the vehicle’s key components (battery charge, tire pressure, engine temperature, etc.).
- The report will include recommended actions or maintenance steps for any identified issues, such as "Check tire pressure," "Schedule battery service," or "Monitor engine temperature."
- If a critical issue is detected, such as a low battery or overheating motor, the system will issue an alert to the user in real time, and provide actionable suggestions (e.g., "Please visit a service center immediately").
- The user will have the option to schedule maintenance or service appointments directly via the app or in-vehicle system, with integrated calendar management.
- All generated reports are stored securely in the cloud, allowing users to access historical data at any time through the app or vehicle system.

#### **6. Exit Conditions**
- Upon successful completion of a health check, the system generates and displays a report to the user, either through the mobile app or in-vehicle display.
- If a critical issue is detected, the system will provide an immediate alert and guidance on the next steps, such as visiting a service center. The user will also be prompted to schedule maintenance or acknowledge the issue.
- The system will store all reports and maintenance schedules in the cloud, allowing users to retrieve the data as needed for future reference or service history.
- If the system encounters an issue, such as a sensor failure or lack of connectivity, it will provide the user with an error message, recommend troubleshooting steps, or offer an option to contact customer support.
- After the health check is complete, the system will log the interaction for future analysis, ensuring that all actions are recorded and accessible to the user for tracking purposes.
