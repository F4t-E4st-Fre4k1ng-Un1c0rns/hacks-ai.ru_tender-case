### 1. Title  
**Technical Specifications for Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface**

### 2. Functional Description  
The **Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface** is designed to enable users of luxury electric vehicles to seamlessly pay for parking using their vehicle's interface. When the vehicle parks in a compatible parking facility, the system will detect the parking session, calculate the appropriate fee, and process the payment through the vehicle’s in-car interface. The system aims to minimize manual input by automatically managing the payment process, generating a receipt, and allowing the user to exit the parking facility without further interaction.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle is equipped with a compatible touchscreen interface and communication hardware (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular connectivity) to interact with the parking facility’s system.
- The user has pre-registered and linked a valid payment method (credit card, debit card, or other acceptable payment forms) to the vehicle’s in-car payment system.
- The parking facility must support integration with the vehicle's Automatic Parking Payment System, including vehicle detection and payment processing.
- The vehicle must be able to detect the parking session through its sensors or communication with the parking facility's infrastructure (e.g., entry gate detection).

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The system is triggered when the vehicle enters a parking space within a compatible parking facility.
- The parking facility detects the vehicle's entry and activates the parking session, which is displayed on the vehicle’s interface.
- The user initiates the payment process by confirming the displayed parking fee details and selecting "Pay" on the vehicle’s interface.
- If the system detects any failure or connectivity issue, a notification is displayed on the vehicle’s interface, prompting the user to take manual action.

### 5. Execution Output  
- Upon successful payment, the system generates a digital receipt that is displayed on the vehicle's interface. The receipt includes transaction details such as parking duration, fee, and payment confirmation.
- The parking fee is charged to the user’s linked payment method, and the payment transaction is recorded in the vehicle’s system for reference.
- The parking facility acknowledges the payment, and the vehicle is allowed to exit without requiring additional manual payment steps.
- If there is an issue with payment or system failure, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted with alternative payment methods or instructed to seek assistance.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The parking session is automatically closed when the vehicle exits the parking space. The payment is confirmed, and the vehicle can exit without further action required from the user.
- If the system encounters a failure (e.g., payment gateway issues or connectivity problems), the user is notified through the interface and may need to manually complete the payment via an alternative method (e.g., parking meter or kiosk).
- After a successful exit, the vehicle’s system logs the transaction and provides a summary to the user, which can be accessed through the vehicle interface or sent via email, depending on the configuration.
