**2. Functional Description**  
The Emergency Roadside Assistance Integration sub-system enables users to request and track emergency roadside assistance in the event of vehicle breakdowns, flat tires, dead batteries, or fuel shortages. The system automatically detects emergencies using internal vehicle diagnostics (e.g., engine failure or system alerts) and allows the user to initiate a request for assistance via the vehicle’s infotainment system. Users can track the status of assistance in real-time and receive notifications of the estimated arrival time and updates on the progress of the roadside service.
