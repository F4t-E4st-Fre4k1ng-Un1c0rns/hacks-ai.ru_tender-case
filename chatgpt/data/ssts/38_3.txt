**Title:**  
Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System - Technical Specifications

**Functional Description:**  
The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System (DBMFS) is designed to actively monitor and analyze the driving habits of the vehicle operator, providing real-time feedback and personalized insights to improve driving behavior, safety, and fuel efficiency. The system collects data through onboard sensors, including speed, acceleration, braking patterns, and cornering, and offers tailored recommendations. These insights aim to encourage safer driving, reduce fuel consumption, and identify opportunities for driver improvement. The system also provides a performance summary after each trip and tracks long-term driving behavior for ongoing feedback.

**Enabling Conditions:**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with an onboard sensor suite that includes GPS, accelerometers, speedometers, and other necessary sensors to track driving behavior accurately.
- The system requires an infotainment unit capable of displaying real-time feedback, providing alerts, and generating detailed reports at the end of each trip.
- The driver must have an active user profile in the vehicle's system, allowing the system to track individual performance and provide personalized feedback.
- Active internet and GPS connectivity are required for real-time feedback, cloud data synchronization, and remote reporting.
- The driver must consent to data collection for analysis and improvement of driving habits, which includes agreeing to share anonymized driving data for fleet or system-wide improvement.

**Trigger Conditions:**  
- The system is automatically activated when the vehicle is started, detecting movement and beginning to collect data on driving behavior.
- The system triggers real-time feedback when predefined thresholds for unsafe behaviors (such as excessive speed, harsh braking, or aggressive acceleration) are exceeded.
- Feedback is generated at the end of each trip, providing a comprehensive report based on the driver's behavior throughout the journey.
- If the system detects a critical behavior (e.g., repeated unsafe driving), it triggers an alert recommending further action, such as driver training or a system reset.

**Execution Output:**  
- The system provides immediate, real-time feedback during the drive through visual alerts and auditory notifications on the vehicle's infotainment display. For example, if the driver is speeding, the system will display a warning and suggest slowing down.
- At the end of each trip, the system generates a detailed performance report, showing the driver’s driving patterns, areas for improvement, and specific recommendations to encourage safer and more efficient driving.
- A personalized feedback score is calculated based on the driver’s performance across various metrics such as smooth acceleration, braking, and adherence to speed limits.
- The system stores long-term driving data, tracking improvements over time, and allows the driver to view historical performance trends to monitor progress.

**Exit Conditions:**  
- The system exits the monitoring phase when the vehicle is turned off or when the trip ends, saving all relevant data to the user profile for future analysis.
- A performance summary report is displayed at the end of each trip, providing a clear overview of the driver’s behavior and improvement suggestions.
- If the system encounters an error (e.g., sensor malfunction or data interruption), it notifies the driver and exits the feedback process until the issue is resolved.
- Upon deactivation or user request, the system ensures that all driving data is either securely stored in the cloud or erased, depending on the user’s privacy settings, ensuring data protection and user control.
