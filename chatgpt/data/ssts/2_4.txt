**1. Title**  
Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance) – Technical Specifications

**2. Functional Description**  
The Driver-Assisted Parking System (Automated Parking Assistance) is designed to provide automatic parking capabilities for luxury electric vehicles. The system will assist the driver in parking the vehicle in various types of parking spaces, such as parallel, perpendicular, and angled spaces. Utilizing a combination of sensors (ultrasonic, radar, and cameras), the system detects available parking spots and automatically navigates the vehicle into the spot. The system will also monitor for obstacles, making adjustments as needed to ensure safe and accurate parking. However, the system may not always function optimally in certain environments, such as areas with poor visibility or when sensors are obstructed.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle is equipped with functional parking sensors, cameras, and required processing hardware to enable automated parking.
- The vehicle's software is installed and configured with the necessary updates to support the Driver-Assisted Parking System.
- The parking space must be large enough to accommodate the vehicle, with sufficient clearance for the system to function properly.
- The vehicle's battery level must be above 20% for the system to engage.
- Environmental conditions should be optimal, with clear visibility for cameras and unobstructed sensors (no heavy rain, snow, or dirt on sensors).
- The user must be in the vehicle, ready to activate the system.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is activated by the user pressing a button or issuing a voice command to start the automated parking process.
- The vehicle is positioned within a suitable proximity to a detected parking space, and the system identifies the space as appropriate for parking.
- The system detects the vehicle's alignment with the parking space and determines the optimal maneuver for parking.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system initiates the parking maneuver by controlling the vehicle's steering, braking, and acceleration to guide it into the parking space.
- Continuous monitoring of the surrounding environment will occur through sensors, adjusting the vehicle's movements in real-time to avoid obstacles and ensure safe parking.
- The system will provide visual feedback to the user, displaying the parking progress on the vehicle's screen.
- Upon successful completion, the vehicle will be parked accurately in the designated space, with the system providing a confirmation alert to the user.
- If a failure occurs, such as the system detecting an obstacle, it will halt the process and notify the user with an error message.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system successfully parks the vehicle within the parking space, and the vehicle comes to a complete stop with no further intervention required from the driver.
- The system deactivates after the parking task is completed, allowing the driver to take control of the vehicle once more.
- In the event of a failure (e.g., an obstacle detected or system malfunction), the system will halt the process and notify the driver with an appropriate error message, reverting control back to the user to park manually.
- If external conditions such as blocked sensors or inadequate parking space are detected, the system will inform the driver and disable automatic parking, requiring manual intervention.
