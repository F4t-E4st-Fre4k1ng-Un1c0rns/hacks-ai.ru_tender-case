**2. Functional Description**  
The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System (DBMFS) is a comprehensive system designed to monitor, evaluate, and provide real-time feedback on the driver's behavior, promoting safer and more efficient driving. It continuously tracks various driving parameters, such as vehicle speed, acceleration, braking, steering patterns, and lane changes. The system alerts the driver when unsafe or inefficient behaviors, such as excessive speed, harsh braking, or improper lane changes, are detected. In addition to real-time feedback, the system generates performance reports after each trip and periodic summaries on a weekly basis, offering actionable suggestions for improvement.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle is equipped with necessary sensors, including GPS, accelerometers, cameras, and motion detectors, all properly calibrated and functioning.
- The Driver Behavior Monitoring and Feedback System is integrated with the vehicle's onboard computer, connected to the central processing unit, and configured to interface with the vehicle's dashboard.
- The system requires an active driver profile to ensure personalized feedback and data collection.
- The vehicle's operating system must support the DBMFS and be capable of processing data in real-time.
- The user interface is functional, providing easy access to real-time feedback, trip summaries, and periodic reports.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The system activates automatically when the vehicle’s engine is started, and the driver begins driving.
- Real-time monitoring is triggered when driving behavior exceeds predefined thresholds, such as speed limits or rapid acceleration/deceleration.
- Alerts are triggered whenever the system detects unsafe behaviors, such as sudden braking, erratic lane changes, or failure to signal lane departures.
- Trigger conditions include deviations from normal driving patterns, which may indicate risky behavior, such as speeding or swerving out of lanes.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system provides real-time feedback through visual and auditory signals whenever unsafe or inefficient driving behaviors are detected, prompting immediate corrective action.
- At the end of each trip, a performance summary is displayed on the dashboard, providing feedback on the driver's behavior and noting areas for improvement.
- A detailed report is generated on a weekly basis, summarizing the driver's overall performance and including specific recommendations for improvement, such as smoother braking or more controlled acceleration.
- The system logs alerts for review by the driver and can store them for future analysis or vehicle maintenance if necessary.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The system stops monitoring when the vehicle is parked and the engine is turned off, or if the driver manually disables the system via the interface.
- Upon exiting, all feedback data and performance reports are saved for future review or analysis.
- In the event of a system malfunction, such as a sensor failure or software crash, the system enters a disabled state and logs an error message, ceasing real-time monitoring until repaired.
- The system automatically exits gracefully, ensuring that no data is lost and that the driver is notified of any issues that may require attention.
