**Title:**  
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication Integration - Technical Specifications

**Functional Description:**  
The Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication Integration sub-system enables seamless communication between luxury electric vehicles and surrounding infrastructure such as smart traffic lights, parking systems, and charging stations. The sub-system facilitates real-time traffic updates, optimal route suggestions, dynamic charging management, and predictive maintenance alerts. The system provides continuous feedback to the driver on infrastructure availability and conditions, improving traffic flow, reducing waiting times at signals, and ensuring efficient use of energy resources.

**Enabling Conditions:**  
- The vehicle is equipped with V2I-compatible communication hardware (e.g., antennas, sensors, communication interfaces) to send and receive data.  
- The surrounding infrastructure supports V2I communication protocols, such as DSRC, 5G, or C-V2X, ensuring compatibility with the vehicle’s system.  
- The vehicle’s software is up-to-date with the latest V2I communication firmware, capable of processing real-time data from infrastructure.  
- The vehicle user has an active account with the service provider, enabling personalized services and integration.  
- The vehicle must be within the communication range of compatible V2I-enabled infrastructure (e.g., smart traffic signals, charging stations, and parking systems).

**Trigger Conditions:**  
- The vehicle enters a connected environment, such as a smart city or a region with V2I-enabled infrastructure within proximity.  
- The driver activates the V2I communication system using the in-car interface or voice commands.  
- The system detects nearby V2I-enabled infrastructure (e.g., traffic signals, charging stations) and establishes a communication link.  
- The vehicle detects route optimization opportunities, such as upcoming smart traffic signals or available charging stations, based on the vehicle’s current location and destination.

**Execution Output:**  
- Real-time updates to the driver on nearby infrastructure, including available charging stations, parking spaces, and smart traffic signals.  
- Dynamic route adjustments based on traffic signal status, minimizing wait times at red lights and optimizing overall route efficiency.  
- Notifications about upcoming infrastructure events, such as road closures, accidents, or maintenance, and recommendations for alternate routes.  
- Charging status updates, including real-time battery levels and suggested charging stations along the route based on vehicle energy needs.  
- Predictive maintenance notifications based on infrastructure feedback (e.g., alerts for potential vehicle issues triggered by road conditions or other connected systems).

**Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions:**  
- The vehicle exits the communication range of V2I infrastructure, causing the system to stop receiving or transmitting data, reverting to traditional navigation.  
- The driver manually deactivates the V2I communication system via the vehicle’s interface or voice command.  
- The vehicle loses connectivity to the infrastructure due to technical issues (e.g., signal loss or temporary infrastructure failure), and the system automatically defaults to conventional navigation without V2I enhancements.  
- The system completes its task, such as optimal route calculation or energy management adjustments, and allows the user to proceed with the journey without further intervention.
