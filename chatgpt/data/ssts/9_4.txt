**1. Title:**  
Vehicle Data Analytics for Fleet Management

---

**2. Functional Description:**  
The Vehicle Data Analytics sub-system provides comprehensive monitoring, analysis, and optimization tools for fleet management, specifically tailored for electric vehicles. It aggregates real-time data from all vehicles in the fleet, allowing managers to track critical performance metrics such as battery health, energy consumption, route efficiency, and vehicle diagnostics. The system supports predictive maintenance, proactive alerts, and fleet-wide insights, enabling data-driven decisions to reduce operational costs, improve vehicle performance, and enhance overall fleet efficiency.

**3. Enabling Conditions:**  
- The sub-system must be integrated with the telematics systems of all vehicles within the fleet to ensure real-time data transfer.  
- Vehicles must be equipped with advanced sensors capable of monitoring performance parameters like battery status, tire pressure, energy consumption, and other critical metrics.  
- Fleet managers and technicians must have secure access to the fleet management platform with role-based permissions.  
- An active internet connection is required for continuous data transmission and real-time analytics.  
- The system must be compatible with the fleet management platform's existing software and infrastructure, with seamless integration to ensure efficient data flow.  
- Data storage must be robust, with secure cloud-based or on-premises storage options to ensure that all vehicle data is retained for historical analysis.

**4. Trigger Conditions:**  
- The sub-system is activated when a fleet manager or technician logs into the fleet management platform and selects the Vehicle Data Analytics module.  
- Real-time vehicle data is continuously monitored, triggering alerts when specific thresholds are crossed (e.g., low battery charge, high energy consumption, or maintenance requirements).  
- Predictive maintenance algorithms are triggered automatically when the system detects potential vehicle performance issues based on usage patterns and sensor data.  
- Alerts are sent when the system identifies abnormal behavior or requires immediate attention (e.g., a vehicle's battery is underperforming or maintenance is overdue).  
- The sub-system also triggers data aggregation and analysis during scheduled fleet-wide data collection sessions.

**5. Execution Output:**  
- The system provides real-time visual analytics, including charts, graphs, and tables that display vehicle health, energy consumption patterns, and performance metrics for individual vehicles and the entire fleet.  
- Predictive maintenance reports are generated, highlighting vehicles that require immediate attention, preventive actions, or parts replacement based on performance data.  
- Alerts are displayed on the dashboard for managers and technicians, indicating any critical issues that require action (e.g., upcoming maintenance, battery degradation).  
- The system generates historical data reports that help identify long-term trends in fleet performance, supporting decision-making for future fleet management and vehicle replacements.  
- Data is automatically logged and stored in a secure database, ensuring full audit trails and accessibility for further analysis and reporting.

**6. Exit Conditions:**  
- The sub-system exits when the user logs out of the fleet management platform or navigates to another module within the system.  
- After generating reports or resolving alerts, the system returns to the dashboard or main interface, allowing the user to continue with other tasks.  
- The system automatically saves data and session information, ensuring that no critical data is lost when a session is ended.  
- In the case of an error or temporary unavailability, the user is notified, and the system exits with a failure message, preserving all data until the issue is resolved.  
- When the session ends or a critical maintenance alert is acknowledged, the system ensures that all relevant data is exported or stored for future reference, complying with data retention requirements.
