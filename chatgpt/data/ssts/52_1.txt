---

### 2. Functional Description  
The **Mobile App-Based Vehicle Usage and Health Monitoring** sub-system is a mobile application-based platform that enables users to monitor and manage the usage and health of their electric vehicle. The system continuously tracks vehicle performance metrics, such as distance traveled, energy consumption, and battery level, while providing real-time diagnostics and alerts for potential issues. Key functionalities include:

- **Vehicle Usage Tracking**: Real-time tracking of energy consumption, mileage, and efficiency metrics.
- **Vehicle Health Monitoring**: Diagnostics and status updates on critical vehicle components, including the battery, motor, and other internal systems.
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Automated notifications for required maintenance, upcoming service intervals, and potential faults.
- **Data Visualization**: Display of historical usage trends, health reports, and predictive analytics regarding vehicle performance.
- **Security**: Encrypted communication and secure user data management compliant with GDPR and relevant regulations.

The system is designed to provide the user with complete control and visibility over their vehicle’s status and health, ensuring timely interventions to maintain optimal performance.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
The following conditions must be met to enable the functionality of the system:

- **Mobile App Installation**: The mobile app must be installed on a supported iOS or Android device, with the latest software updates.
- **Vehicle Connectivity**: The vehicle must have integrated connectivity features (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular) to communicate with the mobile app.
- **User Account Setup**: The user must have registered and logged into the mobile app with an authenticated account.
- **Permissions Granted**: The user must grant the app access to necessary vehicle data, such as location, battery status, and other vehicle diagnostics.
- **Data Encryption and Security**: All data communication between the app and the vehicle must be encrypted, and the system must follow industry-standard security protocols to protect user information.
- **Vehicle Sensor Compatibility**: The vehicle’s internal diagnostic systems and sensors must be operational and capable of transmitting real-time data to the mobile app.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
The following conditions trigger the system to begin monitoring and providing outputs:

- **User Initiates App Interaction**: The system activates when the user opens the mobile app and successfully connects to the vehicle.
- **Vehicle Starts Operation**: When the vehicle is in operation (e.g., engine started or in motion), the system starts tracking usage and health data.
- **Diagnostic Alert Triggered**: The system is activated automatically when any of the vehicle’s diagnostic sensors detect a fault or potential issue, such as low battery or mechanical failure.
- **Maintenance Interval**: When the vehicle reaches predefined usage thresholds (e.g., mileage, energy consumption), the system triggers a reminder or notification for scheduled maintenance or servicing.

### 5. Execution Output  
Upon activation and execution, the system produces the following outputs:

- **Real-Time Usage Data**: Displays real-time data on the vehicle’s energy consumption, mileage, and efficiency.
- **Health Status Report**: Provides a report on the health of the vehicle, detailing the status of critical components such as the battery, motor, and brakes.
- **Push Notifications**: Sends timely alerts to the user regarding low battery, system faults, or upcoming maintenance.
- **Maintenance Recommendations**: Offers recommendations based on vehicle usage data for future maintenance or repairs, along with scheduling options.
- **Data Analytics**: Provides users with visual trends and analytics on vehicle usage, including charts and graphs for long-term performance monitoring.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
The following conditions mark the conclusion of an interaction with the sub-system:

- **User Disconnects from App**: When the user exits or closes the mobile app, real-time data tracking and monitoring stop, and the app enters a dormant state.
- **Vehicle Stops Operation**: If the vehicle is turned off or stationary, the system ceases real-time monitoring until the vehicle is restarted and reconnected to the app.
- **Maintenance Scheduled**: When the user successfully schedules a maintenance appointment through the app, the system logs the action and sends a confirmation to the user.
- **Error or Fault Handling**: If the system encounters an error (e.g., connection failure, data transmission issue), an error message is displayed to the user, and the system logs the fault for troubleshooting.
