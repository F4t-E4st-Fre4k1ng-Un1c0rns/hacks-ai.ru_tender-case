**5. Execution Output**  
- Once the user enters a toll zone or parking area, the system will detect the toll/parking charge and notify the user through the infotainment screen, requesting confirmation for payment.  
- Upon user confirmation, the system will process the payment in real-time, communicating with the toll/parking service provider to complete the transaction.  
- If the payment is successful, the system will display a confirmation message on the infotainment screen, and a digital receipt will be generated and stored within the system for future reference.  
- If the payment is unsuccessful, the system will notify the user with an error message and offer instructions for manual payment (if necessary).  
- The system will continue to monitor the status of the payment, providing any necessary updates to the user regarding payment completion and transaction status.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- The user successfully completes the toll/parking payment through the in-car system, receiving confirmation and a digital receipt for the transaction.  
- If the system fails to communicate with the toll/parking provider, the user will be prompted with an error message and offered alternative payment methods, such as manual payment at the toll booth or parking meter.  
- Once payment is processed, the system will exit the payment flow, returning to the regular driving interface or providing further instructions if needed (e.g., manual payment, follow-up action).  
- The system will store transaction history for future reference and ensure that the user can access receipts and payment logs through the infotainment system or mobile app.  
- The system will be ready to process future toll/parking payments upon entering another toll zone or parking area.
