Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration Technical Specifications

**2. Functional Description**  
The Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration sub-system enables real-time data exchange between vehicles to enhance safety, efficiency, and traffic flow. This includes the sharing of information such as vehicle speed, direction, braking status, and road conditions. The system uses short-range communication technologies like Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) or 5G to establish secure and low-latency communication between vehicles within a specified range (up to 1,000 meters). The system is designed to provide drivers with situational awareness, collision avoidance, and adaptive driving support by sending real-time alerts and data-driven recommendations.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- Vehicles must be equipped with V2V-compatible hardware and software to facilitate communication.
- The communication interface must support DSRC or 5G technologies for reliable data exchange.
- The vehicle must have an operational electrical system to power the V2V system.
- Communication range must be within 1,000 meters for optimal functionality.
- The onboard systems of the vehicle must be capable of processing and interpreting V2V data in real-time.
- V2V communication functionality must be enabled and active by default when the vehicle is powered on.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The V2V system is activated when the vehicle is powered on and in motion.
- The system continuously scans the surrounding environment for nearby vehicles equipped with V2V technology.
- A V2V communication session is initiated when another compatible vehicle enters the communication range.
- The system detects a change in the surrounding environment, such as a nearby vehicle braking or a hazard detected by a neighboring vehicle.
- Communication is triggered when the system receives new data that requires an alert or action to be taken (e.g., a sudden change in road conditions, vehicle speed, or direction).

**5. Execution Output**  
- Upon detecting a nearby vehicle, the system exchanges data such as vehicle speed, direction, and road conditions.
- The system processes the received data and generates real-time alerts for the driver, including visual and audible warnings for potential hazards.
- If a hazard is detected, such as a vehicle braking suddenly, the system activates safety protocols (e.g., automatic braking, collision warning).
- The system continues to deliver situational feedback, such as traffic congestion, road condition updates, and upcoming hazards, throughout the driving session.
- The system may also suggest optimal routing or speed adjustments based on shared vehicle data and real-time conditions.

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**  
- The system deactivates when the vehicle is powered off or when the vehicle exits the communication range of 1,000 meters.
- Communication is suspended if the vehicle's V2V system encounters a malfunction or loss of power, and the vehicle switches to basic safety functions like collision sensors and manual control.
- The system will enter a standby mode when no nearby V2V-equipped vehicles are within range.
- In case of system failure, such as hardware or software malfunction, the system will alert the driver and temporarily suspend all V2V communication functions until the issue is resolved.
- If the vehicle's V2V capabilities are manually disabled, communication will cease, and the system will operate with basic functionality as determined by the vehicle’s internal safety mechanisms.
