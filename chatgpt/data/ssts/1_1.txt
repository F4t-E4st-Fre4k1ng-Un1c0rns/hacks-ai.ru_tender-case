Title: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration - Technical Specifications

Functional Description: The Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V) Integration sub-system enables real-time, bi-directional data exchange between luxury electric vehicles in proximity. This system operates on dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) and/or cellular V2X protocols, allowing vehicles to transmit critical information such as speed, position, direction, and hazard data. V2V communication enhances road safety by enabling timely alerts for potential collisions, road obstacles, and changing traffic conditions. The system is designed to comply with automotive industry standards for secure and reliable data transmission.

Enabling Conditions:

Both vehicles must have active V2V integration hardware and software.
Communication protocols (DSRC or cellular V2X) must be configured and functional.
Vehicles must be within a 300-meter range for data transmission stability.
The V2V feature must be enabled in the vehicle settings, and data sharing permissions must comply with privacy and security standards.
Trigger Conditions:

Detection of another V2V-enabled vehicle within the communication range.
Vehicle speed exceeding 10 km/h to enable dynamic hazard and speed data exchange.
Environmental conditions (e.g., no severe electromagnetic interference) support clear transmission.
Triggered by proximity-based alerts such as rapid deceleration or emergency braking detected in nearby vehicles.
Execution Output:

Real-time transmission of vehicle data, including speed, direction, and location, at intervals of 100 ms.
Hazard alerts with latency below 20 ms, ensuring immediate driver notification.
Diagnostic logs capturing signal strength, data packet integrity, and connection status during the V2V session.
Notification display on the driver interface for any received alerts, with additional auditory cues in case of critical alerts.
Exit Conditions:

The vehicle exits the communication range, or the V2V connection signal drops below the operational threshold.
Either vehicle disables V2V functionality manually or due to system override.
The occurrence of hardware or software faults, triggering automatic disconnection.
Security protocols detect unauthorized access attempts or data irregularities, leading to session termination for safety.
