Vehicle Security System Integration with Home Automation - Technical Specifications  

**Functional Description**  
The Vehicle Security System Integration with Home Automation allows for the basic integration of a luxury electric vehicle’s security system with a home automation network. This feature enables users to lock or unlock their vehicle remotely and monitor its security status through a connected mobile app or home automation hub. The system provides notifications for security alerts (e.g., unauthorized access attempts), but the integration with home automation functions such as lighting or alarm triggers is limited. The feature allows for real-time vehicle status monitoring but does not support advanced home automation synchronization or full integration of all security system capabilities.

**Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must have an installed security system capable of remote communication.  
- The user must have a compatible mobile app or home automation hub capable of connecting to the vehicle’s security system.  
- An active internet connection is required for syncing and notifications, but performance may vary depending on network stability.  
- The home automation system must support basic security integration (e.g., vehicle status updates), but advanced automation features may not be fully supported.  
- The system requires initial configuration for connecting the vehicle with the home automation platform.  

**Trigger Conditions**  
- A user initiates access to the vehicle’s security system through the mobile app or home automation hub.  
- A user requests to lock or unlock the vehicle from the connected interface.  
- A security alert is triggered by the vehicle, such as unauthorized access.  
- The system attempts to sync with the home automation platform for updates or status checks.  
- A user requests an updated status of the vehicle (locked/unlocked).  

**Execution Output**  
- The mobile app or home automation hub displays the current security status of the vehicle (locked/unlocked).  
- Confirmation of actions (e.g., vehicle lock/unlock) is provided, though with potential delays in response time depending on system performance.  
- Alerts related to vehicle security issues are sent to the user, but notifications may not be synchronized immediately or completely with the home automation system.  
- If the vehicle is locked remotely, a confirmation message is shown in the app, indicating the action was successful.  

**Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**  
- The system successfully locks or unlocks the vehicle, or displays an updated security status as requested.  
- The system returns to the home automation hub or mobile app interface after an action is completed.  
- In the event of connectivity issues, an error message is displayed, instructing the user to check network connectivity or follow troubleshooting steps.  
- After an alert or status update, the system returns to the main app interface, displaying the vehicle’s current security status.
