**Technical Specifications for Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface**

1. **Title:**
   Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface

2. **Functional Description:**
   The Automatic Parking Payment System via Vehicle Interface provides an integrated solution for users to automatically detect parking fees and make payments directly through the vehicle’s built-in interface. The system interacts with compatible parking facilities, offering seamless payment processing without requiring users to interact with physical parking meters or mobile applications. The system will display parking details such as parking duration, cost, and a payment confirmation message directly on the vehicle’s interface. It will automatically process payments through a registered payment method and provide a digital receipt.

3. **Enabling Conditions:**
   - The vehicle is equipped with a compatible infotainment system capable of supporting integrated payment solutions.
   - The vehicle’s payment system must be configured to securely store and process the user’s payment method (e.g., credit card, mobile wallet).
   - The vehicle is within the range of a parking facility that supports the Automatic Parking Payment System and is equipped with sensors or compatible payment infrastructure.
   - The vehicle has a stable communication link to the internet or necessary network for interaction with the parking payment system.
   - The user has pre-registered a valid payment method in the vehicle’s system.

4. **Trigger Conditions:**
   - The vehicle parks in a designated parking area equipped with the Automatic Parking Payment System.
   - The system detects the vehicle’s presence in the parking facility and establishes a secure communication link with the facility’s payment infrastructure.
   - Parking details, such as duration and estimated cost, are retrieved from the parking system and displayed on the vehicle’s interface.
   - The user confirms the payment via the vehicle interface, either automatically based on preferences or manually.
   - The user’s payment method is verified, and payment processing begins.

5. **Execution Output:**
   - Once the user confirms the payment, the system processes the transaction securely using the registered payment method.
   - A confirmation message is displayed on the vehicle’s interface indicating the successful payment of the parking fee.
   - A digital receipt is generated and sent to the user’s registered email or mobile device.
   - If there is a failure in payment processing (e.g., network failure, invalid payment method), an error message is displayed on the vehicle’s interface with instructions for resolution (e.g., manual payment via a mobile app or parking meter).

6. **Exit Conditions:**
   - After a successful transaction, the parking facility allows the user to exit, and the parking session is closed.
   - In case of payment failure, the system provides alternative instructions, such as prompting the user to manually complete the payment through a mobile app or a physical parking meter.
   - If payment is successfully processed but the user cannot exit the parking facility, the system logs the issue and prompts the user to contact support for assistance.
