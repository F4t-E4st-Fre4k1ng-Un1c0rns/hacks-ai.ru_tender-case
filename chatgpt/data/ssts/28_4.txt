**Technical Specifications for Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations**

1. **Title**  
Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations

2. **Functional Description**  
The Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations sub-system is designed to provide real-time monitoring and alerting of road conditions to the driver. It utilizes vehicle sensors, GPS data, and external weather information to detect and analyze road hazards such as wet surfaces, icy patches, potholes, construction zones, and debris. The system then provides adaptive recommendations to optimize driving behavior, including speed adjustments, lane changes, and the activation of vehicle safety features such as traction control or automatic braking when necessary. The system continuously adjusts based on real-time conditions to enhance driving safety, comfort, and efficiency.

3. **Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with the following sensors: road surface detection, weather monitoring (e.g., temperature, humidity), GPS, and onboard communication systems for data processing.
- The system must be activated through the vehicle's dashboard or user interface, with the driver consenting to receive notifications regarding road conditions and adaptive recommendations.
- Continuous connectivity to external data sources (e.g., weather services, traffic databases) must be available for the system to receive timely updates on road conditions and weather changes.
- The system must be calibrated for the region of operation, considering local weather patterns, road types, and traffic conditions.
- The vehicle must be operating in an area where the system’s data coverage (including GPS and external services) is available and functioning.

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
- The system is activated when the user selects the "Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations" feature via the vehicle’s interface.
- The system continuously monitors road conditions and will trigger an alert whenever hazardous conditions are detected (e.g., slippery roads, potholes, construction zones).
- Whenever the system detects a significant change in road conditions (e.g., sudden rain, ice formation, road closures), it will automatically issue updated recommendations.
- If the system loses connectivity to external data sources or experiences a sensor malfunction, an error message will be triggered to inform the user of a temporary limitation in functionality.

5. **Execution Output**  
- Real-time alerts are provided to the driver about road conditions through visual, auditory, or haptic feedback (e.g., dashboard warnings, sound notifications, steering wheel vibrations).
- Adaptive driving recommendations are issued, including guidance on adjusting speed, changing lanes, or activating safety features (e.g., traction control, automatic braking) based on the detected road conditions.
- The system updates continuously, providing new alerts and recommendations as road conditions change, ensuring the driver is always informed.
- The system integrates with the vehicle’s automated safety features, such as automatic braking, lane-keeping assistance, and traction control, to implement safety actions when required.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
- The system automatically deactivates when the driver turns off the vehicle or manually disables the "Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations" feature via the dashboard.
- Once the system has delivered its final alert or recommendation in response to detected road conditions, it stops providing updates unless new hazardous conditions are identified during the trip.
- If the system encounters a failure (e.g., sensor error, loss of connectivity), it will display an error message and stop delivering recommendations until the issue is resolved. The system will automatically resume normal functionality once the failure is corrected.
- The system will also cease to output recommendations if the vehicle exits the area where road condition monitoring is available or if the user manually overrides the recommendations.
