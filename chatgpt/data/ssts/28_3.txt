**Technical Specifications: Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations**

1. **Title**  
   Road Condition Alerts and Adaptive Driving Recommendations

2. **Functional Description**  
   The sub-System provides real-time alerts and adaptive recommendations based on detected or reported road conditions such as roadwork, potholes, adverse weather, and traffic disruptions. The system leverages onboard sensors, external data sources, and AI-driven algorithms to provide dynamic suggestions for adjusting driving behavior, including speed, following distance, and cautionary techniques. Alerts and recommendations are delivered through the vehicle’s infotainment system, enhancing safety, comfort, and driving efficiency.

3. **Enabling Conditions**  
   - The vehicle must be equipped with appropriate sensors (e.g., cameras, radar, and GPS) and communication systems.
   - A stable internet connection is required for accessing external data sources such as weather reports and traffic updates.
   - The system is automatically activated when the vehicle is started and in motion, requiring no manual intervention from the driver.
   - The vehicle's sensor systems must be fully functional to ensure accurate detection of road conditions and hazards.

4. **Trigger Conditions**  
   - A change in road conditions detected by onboard sensors (e.g., rough roads, ice, or rain) or reported through external data (e.g., roadwork or accidents).
   - Detection of potential hazards or the need for adaptive driving behavior, such as reduced speed or increased following distance, based on sensor data or weather information.
   - A shift in road environment requiring the system to adjust driving recommendations (e.g., entering a construction zone or encountering fog).

5. **Execution Output**  
   - On-screen alerts appear in the vehicle’s infotainment system, detailing road conditions and recommended driving actions.
   - Adaptive driving recommendations are displayed, which may include suggestions such as reducing speed, increasing following distance, or activating safety features like hazard lights.
   - The system may automatically adjust certain vehicle settings (e.g., hazard lights activation), provided the option is configured for such behavior.
   - Continuous updates are provided to the driver as road conditions evolve or improve.

6. **Exit Conditions**  
   - The system returns to normal driving mode once road conditions are deemed safe, such as the end of roadwork or the clearing of hazardous weather conditions.
   - If there is a failure in the system (e.g., sensor malfunction or loss of external data), the system will alert the driver and may disable certain features until the issue is resolved, providing a status update for troubleshooting.
   - Once the issue is resolved, the system resumes regular operations, providing accurate road condition alerts and adaptive recommendations based on current data.
