### 2. Functional Description:
The Integration of Real-Time Traffic Updates with Navigation sub-system is designed to provide real-time traffic information to optimize travel routes based on live traffic conditions. The system continuously monitors traffic data, providing dynamic route adjustments to avoid traffic jams, accidents, and other disruptions. It enables the navigation system to recalibrate the route, offering alternative paths that reduce travel time and improve overall driving efficiency. The system operates in conjunction with the vehicle’s GPS, internet connection, and third-party traffic data providers to ensure the most accurate, up-to-date traffic information.

### 3. Enabling Conditions:
- The vehicle must have an active GPS system capable of tracking real-time location.
- The vehicle must have an internet connection to access real-time traffic data from third-party services.
- The navigation system must be compatible with live traffic feeds and capable of recalculating routes based on real-time data.
- The user must enable the feature for real-time traffic updates within the vehicle’s system settings.
- The system must be integrated with a reliable third-party traffic data provider to ensure accurate and timely updates.

### 4. Trigger Conditions:
- The system is triggered when the user enters a destination into the navigation system, activating the route planning process.
- The system begins monitoring traffic conditions once the vehicle starts driving and calculates the initial route.
- If traffic disruptions, such as congestion, road closures, or accidents, are detected along the planned route, the system triggers the recalculation of the route to avoid delays.
- The system continuously checks for traffic updates throughout the entire journey, re-triggering recalculations if new disruptions are detected.
- If connectivity is restored after an outage, the system reactivates the traffic update service and adjusts the route based on new data.

### 5. Execution Output:
- The system provides live updates on traffic conditions and suggests alternative routes when disruptions are detected.
- The navigation system recalculates the route dynamically based on real-time data, offering the user a more efficient path if necessary.
- The system alerts the user to traffic incidents or delays along the route and notifies them of available detours.
- The system displays updated driving directions on the vehicle’s display screen, reflecting the newly calculated route.
- Continuous updates are provided until the user reaches the destination, ensuring real-time navigation adjustments are available throughout the journey.

### 6. Exit Conditions:
- The system exits the real-time traffic update mode once the vehicle reaches the destination or when the user disables the feature.
- If the system loses connectivity to real-time data providers, the navigation system reverts to static route guidance, using offline maps, until connectivity is restored.
- The system terminates live traffic updates once the destination is reached, and no further traffic adjustments are necessary.
