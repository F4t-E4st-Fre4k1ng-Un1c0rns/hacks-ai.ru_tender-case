**1. Title**  
- Integration of Third-Party Apps into Car Infotainment System

**2. Functional Description**  
This sub-system allows the integration of selected third-party applications into the car's infotainment system. The supported third-party apps, such as music streaming, navigation, and communication apps, are accessible via the car's central display, providing users with the ability to control and interact with these apps using voice commands, touchscreen, or physical controls. The integration enhances the driving experience by enabling convenient access to these services while ensuring safety and ease of use.

**3. Enabling Conditions**

- The mobile device should have Bluetooth, USB, or Wi-Fi capability for connection to the infotainment system.
- The vehicle must have a stable internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data) to support real-time app integration.
- The user must have the required third-party apps installed and authenticated on their mobile device.
- The infotainment system must have the necessary software version to support the third-party app integration.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The user connects their mobile device to the infotainment system via Bluetooth, USB, or Wi-Fi.
- Upon successful connection, the infotainment system prompts the user to enable access to compatible third-party apps.
- The user selects the third-party apps option from the infotainment menu to start the integration process.
- The user selects a third-party app (e.g., Spotify, Google Maps) from the list of available applications shown on the screen.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The infotainment system successfully integrates with the selected third-party app, displaying the app’s user interface on the car's infotainment screen.
- The user can interact with the app using the car's touchscreen or voice commands, such as playing music, starting navigation, or sending messages.
- The infotainment system allows basic control features, including play/pause, volume control, route selection, and voice search, depending on the app’s capabilities.
- The system will show app-specific content, such as playlists, navigation maps, or messages, in a user-friendly layout suitable for in-car use.
- The user is able to seamlessly transition between apps within the system, although switching may involve minor delays.

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Conditions**  
- The user exits the third-party app by selecting another app, returning to the main infotainment screen, or using voice commands to deactivate the app.
- If the mobile device is disconnected or loses connection, the third-party app is automatically closed, and the system returns to the main menu.
- The system will provide a prompt if the app experiences an error, asking the user to reconnect or retry the operation.
- If the app is closed, the system returns to the previous screen or the default screen, depending on the user’s last action. If the user exits the app by disconnecting the device, the system will prompt for reconnection if the device is still within range.
