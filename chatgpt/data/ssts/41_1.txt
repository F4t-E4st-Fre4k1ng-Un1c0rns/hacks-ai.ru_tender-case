Setting Geofences for Vehicle Tracking and Monitoring

---

**2. Functional Description**  
The "Setting Geofences for Vehicle Tracking and Monitoring" sub-system allows users to define geographic boundaries around specific locations. These geofences are linked to vehicles within a fleet, enabling real-time tracking and the generation of alerts when vehicles enter or exit these areas. This functionality enhances fleet management, vehicle security, and operational efficiency by notifying users of unauthorized movements or deviations from predefined zones. The system integrates with GPS technology and vehicle sensors, ensuring accurate tracking and timely alerts.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicles must be equipped with GPS tracking systems and integrated with the fleet management platform.  
- The user must have valid credentials and access rights to create and modify geofences within the system.  
- The system must be connected to the internet for real-time data transmission and notifications.  
- The system must have access to an up-to-date map of the geofenced areas, enabling accurate geofence creation.  
- The backend infrastructure must support scalable geofence creation and real-time event processing for multiple vehicles.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- A user initiates the creation or modification of a geofence through the system's user interface.  
- A vehicle enters or exits a predefined geofence area.  
- A system event triggers an automatic revalidation or refresh of geofence boundaries.  
- A scheduled system check or error in GPS data triggers an update or verification of the geofencing parameters.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system successfully creates or modifies the geofence and associates it with the selected vehicle(s).  
- The system records and stores data on vehicle movements relative to geofence boundaries.  
- Notifications are sent to the user when a vehicle enters or exits the geofence, with time-stamped event data.  
- The system logs all geofence-related actions, including creation, modification, and vehicle entry/exit events, for audit and reporting purposes.  
- A confirmation message is displayed to the user upon successful setup or modification of the geofence.  

---

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- A vehicle exits the geofence, triggering an exit notification and logging the event in the system.  
- The geofence is removed, disabled, or modified by the user, which triggers system reconfiguration.  
- System errors or connectivity issues result in the failure to provide real-time alerts or geofence status updates.  
- The system performs a scheduled timeout or fallback operation in case of delayed GPS data or network issues, and the geofence status is temporarily paused.
