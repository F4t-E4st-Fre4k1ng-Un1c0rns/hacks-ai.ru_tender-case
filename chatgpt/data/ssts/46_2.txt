**1. Title**  
Automatic Synchronization of Vehicle Settings across Multiple Devices

**2. Functional Description**  
This sub-System allows the automatic synchronization of a user’s personalized vehicle settings—such as seat positioning, climate control, infotainment options, and driving mode preferences—across multiple authorized devices. These settings are seamlessly applied whenever the user logs into a vehicle with a registered device, providing a personalized experience without manual adjustments. If connectivity is temporarily lost, any in-vehicle changes are stored locally and synchronized to the cloud when connectivity is restored, ensuring the latest preferences are accessible from any device.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The user has an active account with registered credentials and has authorized devices linked to their profile.
- All connected devices are authenticated and have either network access or are within the vehicle’s local network range.
- Cloud synchronization services are enabled and accessible via the internet or internal vehicle network.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- The user logs in with a linked device upon entering the vehicle, initiating synchronization automatically.
- If a session is already active, any in-vehicle adjustments automatically update the user’s preferences across all devices.

**5. Execution Output**  
Upon successful synchronization, the vehicle applies the user’s settings as stored in the cloud or as last adjusted on any connected device. This includes seat position, climate control, infotainment settings, and any real-time changes made by the user. If network access is unavailable, settings updates are saved locally and queued for later synchronization.

**6. Exit Conditions**  
- Synchronization completes successfully, and the system updates user preferences both in the vehicle and on the cloud for future access across devices.
- In the case of a network failure, the sub-System stores user preferences locally within the vehicle. Once connectivity is restored, these preferences are automatically synchronized to the cloud, ensuring consistency across all authorized devices.
