### 1. Title  
**Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring**

### 2. Functional Description  
The Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts and Compliance Monitoring sub-system is designed to provide real-time alerts to the driver when the vehicle exceeds local speed limits. It continuously monitors the vehicle's speed and compares it with accurate, up-to-date speed limit data, ensuring compliance with traffic laws. In case of a speed violation, the system immediately triggers an audible and visual alert on the vehicle's dashboard. The system also logs each instance of non-compliance for future review and provides a comprehensive compliance report to the vehicle owner.

### 3. Enabling Conditions  
- The vehicle’s GPS system is operational and provides accurate location data.
- The vehicle is connected to a real-time traffic data source that provides up-to-date speed limit information for the vehicle’s current location.
- The vehicle’s speed measurement system is calibrated and operational, with an accuracy margin of ±1 km/h.
- The Vehicle Speed Limit Alerts feature is enabled through the vehicle’s settings by the driver.
- The system is integrated with the vehicle’s dashboard, infotainment display, or heads-up display to show alerts and notifications.
- The system is connected to cloud services for real-time updates to speed limit data.

### 4. Trigger Conditions  
- The system continuously monitors the vehicle’s speed and compares it with the local speed limit for the current location.
- A trigger occurs when the vehicle exceeds the local speed limit by 3 km/h or more.
- The system also triggers if the speed limit data is updated, indicating a change in the local speed limit (e.g., entering a new zone with a different speed limit).
- The system will trigger an alert if the vehicle exceeds the speed limit regardless of whether GPS signal is stable, using cached speed limit data as a backup when necessary.
- The system will automatically recheck speed limits upon re-establishing GPS signal or after data synchronization from the cloud.

### 5. Execution Output  
- Upon exceeding the speed limit by more than 3 km/h, the system outputs an audible alert (e.g., chime or spoken warning) and displays a visual message on the dashboard or infotainment display, indicating the speed limit violation.
- The system logs each instance of a speed limit violation, storing the time, location, and degree of violation for future review.
- If the system cannot retrieve real-time speed limit data, it will provide a notification to the driver, explaining the potential limitations and advising caution.
- The system continuously monitors the vehicle’s speed and adjusts the alerts accordingly. Once the driver reduces speed to below the limit, the alert ceases.
- At the end of a trip, the system generates a compliance report summarizing any violations and confirming adherence to speed limits.

### 6. Exit Conditions  
- The system stops providing alerts once the vehicle’s speed is reduced to within 3 km/h of the local speed limit or when the vehicle has reached the speed limit.
- If the system detects a critical issue (e.g., GPS signal loss for an extended period), it will disable speed limit monitoring temporarily, and the driver will be notified to manually monitor speed.
- When the driver disables the Speed Limit Alerts feature through the vehicle’s settings, the system ceases to monitor speed limits and will not provide further alerts or logging until re-enabled.
- The system will resume normal function once the GPS signal is restored, or the vehicle re-enters a zone with valid speed limit data.
