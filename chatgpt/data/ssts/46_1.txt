**Technical Specifications for Automatic Synchronization of Vehicle Settings across Multiple Devices**

**1. Title**  
Automatic Synchronization of Vehicle Settings across Multiple Devices

**2. Functional Description**  
This sub-System enables seamless synchronization of a user's vehicle settings (including seat position, climate control, multimedia preferences, etc.) across multiple devices (smartphones, tablets, in-vehicle display systems, etc.). The synchronization occurs in real-time or near real-time to ensure that the user’s preferences are consistently applied across all devices that interact with the vehicle. This functionality allows users to easily transition between devices while maintaining their customized settings, enhancing user experience and convenience.

**3. Enabling Conditions**  
- The vehicle must be equipped with a cloud-based system for storing and retrieving user settings across devices.
- The user must have an active and valid account within the vehicle's ecosystem (e.g., cloud service or companion app).
- All devices (smartphone, tablet, in-car infotainment system, etc.) must be connected to the vehicle’s system through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
- The user must have previously configured personalized settings (seat position, temperature, audio preferences) through any connected device and enabled synchronization features.
- The vehicle must support real-time or near real-time data transfer between devices for synchronization.

**4. Trigger Conditions**  
- A device (smartphone, tablet, or in-vehicle system) makes a request to synchronize vehicle settings with the cloud or another device.
- The user changes a preference (seat position, climate control, etc.) via a connected device, prompting the system to sync settings across all other devices.
- The vehicle detects a change in user settings (e.g., seat adjustment, climate setting) that needs to be updated across connected devices.
- The user accesses or switches between multiple devices, triggering a synchronization process to ensure all devices reflect the current settings.

**5. Execution Output**  
- The system synchronizes user settings (such as seat position, climate control, multimedia preferences, etc.) in real-time or near real-time across all devices.
- Any updated settings on a connected device are reflected in real time or within a few seconds across all other devices.
- The vehicle adjusts its internal systems (e.g., seat position, climate control, multimedia) according to the settings from the active device.
- A synchronization confirmation message is provided to the user on the device where the change was made, and the vehicle shows visual feedback indicating that settings have been updated successfully.

**6. Exit Conditions/Exit Criteria**  
- The system successfully synchronizes the user settings across all connected devices, ensuring that the vehicle's settings match the most recent preferences from any device.
- If the synchronization process completes successfully, all devices reflect the updated preferences, and the vehicle adjusts to the corresponding settings (e.g., seat position, climate, media).
- If synchronization fails (due to network issues, device disconnection, or service unavailability), the system reverts to the last known valid settings, and the user is notified of the failure. Once the connection is restored, synchronization will resume automatically.
